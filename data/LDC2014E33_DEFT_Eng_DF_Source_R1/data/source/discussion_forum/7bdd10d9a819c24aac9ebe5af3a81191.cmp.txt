This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

Hate to point out the obvious (I lie) but when Murdoch inherited those tow papers in Australia he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country. He then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth. If that is not a self made man I have never heard of one.
