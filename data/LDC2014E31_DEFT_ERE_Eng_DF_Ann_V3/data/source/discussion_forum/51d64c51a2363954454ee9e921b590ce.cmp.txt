I dont know if you're trolling or not? But, what makes you think muslims try to convert the people around them?

Lets be honest, the majority of the EDL are pretty closed-minded. They're not trying to get rid of all other ethnicities to make this country composed of just britons; but muslims, because muslims are now portrayed as malicous beings that caused the 9/11. Before bombings, 9/11, etc. EDL and BNP did not exist or atleast were not active and muslims were not targeted by such parties as such. Mass media has caused much of the commotion. However, EDL's common members lack the intellect to be able to comprehend this. want evidence? check out the EDL's facebook page and their forums and observe the ignorance some of the members display in response to some situations. It's pathetic.

EDL appear to have been started by people who (rightly) didn't want to be taken over in their own towns and have them converted to Islam. Why should they? Why should they be second class citizens?

Violent people siding with them, the media and people on here give them a bad name i suppose.

No one's being forced to convert to Islam. That's against Islam in itself. Tell me how they are second class citizens?

Also, here's something where their leader called "every single Muslim" responsible for 7/7. Really, even those that died as a result?

As I said, it's the wrong way to go about it but it'd proof not everybody wants the whole multiculturalism lark. That's all.

Hooligans in disguise, but atleast it's amusing when they hype up marches expecting 3000 people then 200 turn up, so they end up provoking people and then run away on coaches <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

There was a protest outside the Blackburn KFC who were trialling so called "halal" meat and EDL were protesting outside. Although the food wasn't really halal because it was stunned first this still made me laugh. A comment on their facebook page reads.

Tonight the turn out at the KFC was pathetic! All the so-called members of the Blackburn division and we have six stood up there! We need to sort this out!

The EDL aren't racist, they have Muslim and minority members. They oppose Islamification of a largely secular country. Racism is putting down other races; Islam has nothing to do with that. We don't want Mosques everywhere in this country...fair play on the EDL.

Do you think the world will LET that happen? The last European massacre I remember was in Bosnia and the world intervened to stop it, where the perpetrators behind it now face international court

Then why did Tommy threaten "every single Muslim"? Also, I thought the EDL wants freedom and democracy? If they really want freedom and democracy, then they should recognise that as part of democracy, you get freedom of religion and from religion ie: you don't have to belong to any religion, but you are also allowed to practise your religion and by practising, it does mean putting religious buildings up

They do love playing divide and rule.
150 years ago, they divided and then enslaved the black population for no reason other than the advancement of the white race, at a direct cost to those of the blacks.
If they were capable of this just 150 years ago, what makes you think they have changed since then?

LOL black people enslaved themselves in return for goods. I guess black people were technologically disadvantaged and thus they were exploited because they were weak
