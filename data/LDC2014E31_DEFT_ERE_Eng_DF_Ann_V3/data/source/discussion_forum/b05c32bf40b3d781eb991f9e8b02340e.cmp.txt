I know it's stupid, his suggestion that not all senior officers should start from the bottom does not sit comfortably with me

I think it's a great fact that in the constabularies of this country, our chief officers all had started a constable

I think it is the only way, Chief fire officers have to start from a recruit firefighter, they have tried fast-tracking with fire officers and they are a liability and are dangerous out on the fire field.

I think that Cameron should definitely resign.

The people of the UK have been let down by some members of the Government, the police and the media. We collective pay all their salaries and some of them have betrayed us and abused their positions, whilst they benefit and claim to be working on our behalf.

The expected five year timespan of the initial police inquiry is too long to wait and see which politicians can be proven guilty.

NI has been held accountable already. We await to see who exactly is proven to have done what but the people in charge are already being held accountable and more is likely to follow with the current investigations.

Those in charge within the police have also accepted responsibility and are being held accountable. Officers are being investigated.

The Politicians are arguing over who was where, when, what happened, if it even happened? <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> None of them have been made to resign, non are being investigated that I know of.

I think it's important that Cameron resigns as he is the man in charge and therefore the man responsible. The government can't be seen to be the only people to do nothing for years until later when they are forced to.. although that tactic sounds familiar. Another similar tactic of course being that they weren't there at the time, or moving from one post to another. The government of the UK can't shift the blame again to those that came before them or sit on the other side of the room. Non of the current selection acted until they were forced to... well not enough of them anyhow!

I also think it's important that he is made to resign as we need to send a clear warning to all current and future politicians that being part of what is slowly becoming clear was common practice for years will not be tolerated and nor will doing nothing about it and letting it go on. Which is perhaps a reason for Brown to also resign.

The people of the UK have a chance to show that we are still in control and collectively we run this country, not the media, the police or the politicians.

For what reason?

Because he hired someone who seems to have acted entirely properly in the job he was hired to do?

(In contrast to predecessors such as Damian McBride)

Ed Miliband is being a buffoon to call this the most catastrophic decision by a PM ever. Worse than going into Iraq? In terms of propriety, how about Ecclestone and tobacco advertising?

The cosy relationship between police, media and politicians certainly needs to be sorted out. But calls for Cameron to resign are just ridiculous.

I understand others will have different view points, but I don't think there's anything ridiculous about my post at all, it's a Point of View..

I won't bother with arguing over party politics, well not until we have independant political parties in the UK rather than the United Colours of Murdoch.

Hi BM. I'm no big fan of Cameron, but I'm not so sure.

A PM resigning can cause all sorts of wobbles, and I don't think he should resign for what he's done anyway. Sorry, that should say what we currently know he's done.

Appointing Coulson was an error of judgement - a bad error. All PMs will make these errors, and it's right that the public should judge him on this at the next election, along with everything else his government does.

If it turns out that there has been greater collusion between the Conservatives and NI, or that he knew more about Coulson, then maybe he should go. But right now I'm not sure he should go just for employong a bloke that he was warned off, even if it appears those warnings were correct.

Just my opinion.
