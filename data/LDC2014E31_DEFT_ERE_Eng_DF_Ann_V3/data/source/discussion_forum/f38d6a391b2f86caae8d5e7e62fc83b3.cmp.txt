Yeh, I'm sure I contributed to an element of arguing when it wasn't necessary.

I guess I was obscure in the idea, clear in my own mind, that some shoes could be a poor choice for people with certain kinds of foot pronation. I don't know that they are, just that they well might be, and that understanding about your type of pronation could be useful. I assume that if pronation is "normal" the shoes may be just fine; if not, yes, I might see an orthopedist for an opinion.

May we all have happy feet....

Hey you guys! I'm here to defend the Fluevog!!

I'm sorry if you find them ugly, Chai, but I mentioned them because I bought a pair when Fox &amp; Fluevog had one of their first outlets in Gastown, Vancouver, way back in the hippy-dippy days... (we're talking early 1970's)...

I paid the astronomical sum of $35 for a pair of their clogs (open-toed) which, when my salary was $500/month, was a lot!! They were the most comfy shoe I have ever worn. So there!

I could afford a pair today, but like you say, they are fugly! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

Just to prove I'm not making it up <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

John and his longtime friend and ex - partner, Peter Fox, go back to biblical times. In those days, such scriptural characters as Methuselah lived to be, quite literally, thousands of years old. John, himself, is thousands of years old and Peter Fox is, in fact, Methuselah. Before they founded Fox &amp; Fluevog, in the ancient biblical age of 1970, they were shepherds. Actually, they worked at Sheppard's, a venerable Vancouver shoe emporium, albeit a tad on the conventional side. As you can imagine, John and Peter felt a wee bit constrained, selling brogues all day to businessmen in suits and servicing only the occasional hipster. When, one day, the miraculous happened, it was followed by the inevitable: an old warehouse full of turn - of - the - century footwear (men's &amp; women's, in mint condition, no less) became available to buy at one ridiculously low price. In a nanosecond, John and Peter were out the door and into their own store, fully stocked with brand new fifty year old shoes that, in 1969, were right in style. Fox &amp; Fluevog immediately became the very coolest place to treat the feet and has remained so ever since. Around 1980, Peter heard the siren song of New York City and moved there to open his own store, specializing in design of Ladies' (particularly wedding) shoes. John took over the business and built it into the multinational mega corporation it is today, along the way forging his undaunted reputation for the world's most distinctive shoes.

Wow, Mame, I'm seeing a whole new side of you! LOL

I'd like to put my.02c worth of shoe stories too, because I worked for Florsheim Shoe Company about ten lifetimes ago.

Back in those days, we used to be able to buy shoes at 55 percent of retail, and they were really great shoes - made in Chicago. I still have Florsheims in my closet that still looks new, and I bought those back in the sixties and seventies. They're still comfortable on my feet, but I wear them only on special occasions.

A few years ago, Florsheim Shoe Company went bankrupt, but a few months ago, the Florsheim brothers bought back the name and re-established their company. I wish them luck.

Danskos woman here. I am going to have to look up fluevogs...

I did try earth shoes once, in Westwood, just about ran out of the store, not so much re the ugliness, but from the cultural whappo, and my own imbalance.

Time passes, and if people like them, fine.

CI - why am I not shocked that you have perfectly good 30 and 40 yr old shoes in your closet? <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/> I would never have guessed that, but I am not surprised <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/> Good for you - I wish I still had those clogs. That was the first purchase I made with my first paycheque as a 17 yr old working in 'downtown Vancouver' so it was very memorable. Plus, they had a hippy design on the leather <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Shite, osso, now I'm going to have to look up Danskos! grrr...

Well, more about me -

fine leather soled shoes, such as florshiems' dress shoes, were I man, would have me on foot death's door. With my arch and metatarsals' failure to 'rotate', the fine sole becomes an upward battering ram. I also can't wear too cushioned soles - as I've found out by buying some very expensive walking shoes - my feet seem to be attempting to break with those.

I tried on some whatchacallits once, the tough punk sort of boots, forget the name. My version of hell.
