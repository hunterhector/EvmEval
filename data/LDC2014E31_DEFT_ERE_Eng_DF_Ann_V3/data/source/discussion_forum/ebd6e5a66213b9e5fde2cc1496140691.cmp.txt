The US nuked Japan because the Japanese wouldn't surrender and thus, an invasion of the island would've been necessary, something which would've caused even more carnage than the decimation of both cities itself.

A large chunk of US foreign policy is not controlled by "crazy Jewish and Christian groups." Firstly, they're pro-Israel groups, do not bring the Jews into this as some of them couldn't care less about Israel or the US. Secondly, enlighten me, how've the Christian loonies been shaping up the US? The US will eventually have same sex marriages, thus your theory goes right out the window.

Iran is sane by comparison? Oh, silly me, I forgot about the stoning that still goes on in the country. Yes, you're right, completely sane.

That's the most imbecilic comment you've written so far, just wait until the hawkish neocons take office in 2012. They'll turn Iran into one giant crater. I don't in any way, shape or form support this but to think that Iran will be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon is absurd.

Now begone.

The Iranian people support Iran's nuclear right.

There is no proof Iran is developing nuclear technology and they have only enriched to 20 percent which is the required amount for their research in Tehran.

The US nuked Japan because it is an evil nation which has a long history of war crimes and human rights abuse in other peoples countries.

I think you will find Jewish and zionist Christians form some fo the most powerful Lobbies in the US. Your ignorance on this is astounding. It is these groups who push for an Anti-Iranian foreign policy in America.

America executes people as well as Iran. Don;t try and play cultural elitism on this issue.

When you claim American government officials want to destroy Iran it only supports my argument that Iran needs a Nuclear weapon.

Now you begone, this is my thread.

After discussion with Iranian friends, I would say the educated classes do not support the nuclear policy. The Islamic nut jobs may be more enthusiastic, but these are the guys who are trying to hasten the end of days.

With a few exceptions, US foreign policy was incredibly insular up until WWII and the dropping of the bomb. Your reasoning does not follow.

Your bogey men are overrated. There are also plenty of non-Jewish/Christian loonys who are concerned about the possibility of a nation whose President wishes to hasten judgement day acquiring nuclear weapons.

For all its failings America does not stone women for adultery or hang homosexuals. There is no rush for Iranian passports.
