For the record: there is no 'class' in the United States of America. It is not a class based society. 'Class warfare' is what politicians use to divide Americans from each other - because that makes it easier for them to rob us all.

Only fucking morons support Democrats or Republicans. You people are the problem.

You're confusing the word, "class," with the word, "caste,"

We don't have a caste system like India (or England, to a lesser extent).

But we do have a class system. Money and power are the usual determinants.

I agree on the miscarriage of justice. laws should be for everyone.

It is far more likely that a poor person committing a crime will be convicted, but there's a lot more to the issue than just convictions. A wealthy person is less likely to be charged. If he is, then he will have better lawyers. If convicted, he will get a lighter sentence. Once in prison, he more likely to be paroled. This is nothing new.

Yep, and in the worst case buy a presidential pardon.

California Girl is correct. We don't have a Class sytem yet. That carries major implications within society. If you are of the upper class in England (whether you are rich or not) there are doors open to you that no amount of money will buy entry into. The same holds true for India as well.

Here in the States you can buy entry through any door you see.

A very clear miscarriage of justice. I wonder how much the DA cost to be bought off. One million? Two? Ten? Whatever the amount was, I hope he sold his soul and his ethics for a high amount.

That case is only one example of a systemic problem that pervades the entire criminal justice system.

Hell, I didn't even mention the fact that rich people can afford better legal counsel. After all, do you think O J Simpson would have gotten away with murder in the 90's without his 'dream team'?

I am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since...well, mankind got 'organized'. Who wrote "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others," and when did he write it?

justice is sometimes a matter of simply, what you can afford. It has always been so.

here is another link to the story.

According to this the 2 misdemeanors are due to a plea deal, and the guy is pleading guilty to it. Furthermore it is his first offense, and no drugs or alcohol were involved.

In most juristictions if it is your first offense you can usually get anything below attempted murder or rape plead down to a lesser charge.

Also, now that he has plead guilty the victim can sue the living shit out of him. THAT is where the more well off can get slammed by the system. There will be 100 lawyers willing to take this case, and a deal won't come cheap for the driver. If you also read down, the whole thing about not affecting his livelyhood is explained as making sure he can still afford resitution.

Not when someone is seriously injured. That places it into a whole new level. My assumption is the scumbag paid a huge anmount to the victim so that he would be OK with the reduced charges, then said scumbag paid a large amount to the DA's re-election campaign and there you have it. Justice is served...or sauteed if you prefer.
