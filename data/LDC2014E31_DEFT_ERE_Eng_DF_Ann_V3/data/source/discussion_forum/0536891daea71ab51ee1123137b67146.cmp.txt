So essentially, for completely SUPERFICIAL reasons, we are rejecting the most qualified candidate and nominating a Ken Doll, hoping to God no one notices his religion is batshit crazy and he's flip-flopped on every issue out there.

Yup. Makes sense to me.

Those aren't superficial reasons. Gingrich is not a leader, at least not of the most important country on earth. The people whom he led in the past don't want him now, and his temperament is not suited to the Presidency.

Sorry.

Given those people were a large part of the problem, and couldn't wait to get back to making deals with the other side, not seeing their objections as being the problem.

I look at the results- Balanced budgets (kind of), welfare reform and serious changes in the way Congress did business.

But, heck, no, we don't want any real reform. We want a guy who is going to cut more deals with the special interests, because that's worked so well for the country.

Sure, I like Gingrich. He's a very smart man. He did some good things in office so we have to give credit where credit is due. I even considered supporting him. But I won't be.

I thought you said in another thread that you weren't voting in the GOP Primaries... It's kind of hard to keep your stories straight though...

And, hey, that cartoon you have in your sig line is just kind of creepy. Just sayin'. Bring back the kitten.

As [House] speaker, I came back, working with President Bill Clinton. We passed a very Reagan-like program: less regulation, lower taxes. Unemployment dropped to 4.2 percent. We created 11 million jobs.  Newt Gingrich

</quote>

"Former president Clinton would be shocked at this description, since he always credited the 22 million jobs created during his presidency to the deficit-reduction package he narrowly passed early in his tenure without a single GOP vote. "

I'm not a huge fan, but I have to give credit where credit is due and he's wiping the floor with the republican field in these debates. I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses. He definitely offers the most substance in his replies, but a lot gets lost in translation. Romney is a milquetoast douchewagon who can't even give a straight answer to a simple question like 'do the states have the right to ban contraception?'

Get used to the idea of 4 more years of the Oh-Boy. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

I don't think that anyone has "killed it" in the debates.

I think Newt has been the most accurate and forthright. He has been married 3 times, currently for 13 years to Calista, and I respect the fact that, in spite of political consequences, he has been divorced 2 times, rather than having a sting of lovers, while married to one woman, as so many other politicians try to get away with. I like Newt because I trust Newt. He is the least PC of them all, thus far, and in my opinion.

Justin Quinn: "Gingrich has been married three times, and he has been accused of having a multitude of extramarital affairs, although he has only admitted to one -- with the woman who would eventually become his third and present wife."

Newt has been neither forthright or accurate. The constant stream of Pinocchios he has gotten from the Washington Post, on easily checked facts, demonstrates this.

Not that it will matter to the wingnuts who rely more on truthiness than truth.
