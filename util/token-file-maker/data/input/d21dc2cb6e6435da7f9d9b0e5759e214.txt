Hi Lovepigeon,
Can't say what you want but can tell you what we did.
We had a civil ceromony at a country house, with a wedding breakfast.
Thats where we desided to spend the money.
On the savings side...........................
A friend made the cake, another played guitar before the ceromony,
My dress was from John Lewis (not a wedding dress) 'A' hired his suit,
(had shirt made, as wedding present from me) 'A' played in a band, played in the evening.
We invited who we wanted, (yes we left out some people inc family)
We didn't have a top table, we didn't do speaches or a 1st dance.
It was our day, how we wanted and it was WONDERFUL.
We went to Brughe (sp ?) booked flights &amp; hotel online the day before the wedding. Bargin and Fab.

You just have to think WHAT YOU WANT, it may seem tough on others.
BUT IT's YOUR DAY.

We ended up with a more elaborate wedding than originally planned because we went to Speke Hall to look around and I fell in love with it (doubling our budget *oops*).

But what I'd have gone for in your situation would be a registry office wedding with two witnesses and a party in the evening. Hire a village hall (normally very cheap), fill an iPod with music and borrow some speakers, get some platters of meat, cheese, salad and bread and some wine (you can get some great deals if you can take a day trip to Calais), and invite your family.

Having said that, we had our evening dinner at a really nice restaurant (has a Bib Gourmand) - 26 people, three courses plus coffee and great wine and soft drinks and the total cost was £790. The buffet/music/buying the drinks in/hire a hall option for a larger group would have been a little bit more, so it depends on how many people you want to invite.

I think it's quite sad that there's such a huge "wedding industry" these days and most people seem to feel the ONLY way to get married is to have a massively expensive party for dozens of people.
We seem to have lost sight of the meaning of the whole thing...is it only me who thinks it odd that weddings should be held in settings and in a style which bears no relation to the couple's real life together?
I don't mean that if a couple both work stacking shelves, they should be getting married in a supermarket - more that we should consider weddings at home or near home, with friends and the sort of food we really enjoy, to be the norm.
I always think the twee starters/roast dinner/fake-looking pudding type menu is very peculiar when you remember that most couples would probably sit down to something totally different in almost any other situation!

I think all of your options sound really expensive! (disclaimer - I'm not engaged or planning a wedding, but I am in a long term relationship, thinking about it possibly when debt free).

I have always felt that people spend shocking amounts on weddings - I think your 3-4k is massive, let along the tens of thousands that some spend!

I like the ideas that Jody and Sugarspun have mentioned. Have a quiet registry marriage with just the important people there, followed by a party for everyone done cheaply. I wouldn't budget anywhere near 3-4k on it though!
If a honeymoon is really important to you, you can still spend a grand or so on that, it counts as a holiday that you might have taken anyway I guess.
