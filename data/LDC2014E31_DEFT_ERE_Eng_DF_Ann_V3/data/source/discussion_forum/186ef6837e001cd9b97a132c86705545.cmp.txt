When I went to vote today I ended up having a rather heated discussion with the 'yes party' campaigners that were standing outside the door of the polling station. At one point they also walked up and down the student flats in the area approaching any students that came out the door.

What annoyed me the most about these campaigners was the EXTREMELY aggressive approach they were taking. One girl had a mega phone and was shouting things like 'If you vote no the BNP will get in' etc. I watched her approach a group of students who said they didn't really know anything about the two voting systems and she then proceeded to give them a very biased overview. There were no representatives from the 'no party'. From my point of view, this was extremely unfair as it didn't give students the chance to make an educated judgement.

Surely this kind of aggressive campaign is completely unethical? From what I could see they were trying to convince the students who had less knowledge about the new voting system into voting for them. I was going to vote yes but I was so appalled by the parties' representatives at the polling station that I decided not to vote at all.

IMO it is completely unethical, especially for a party who claims they are campaigning for a 'fairer voting system' to attempt to pressure passers by into voting for them. Especially since they were stood right outside the polling station and the aggressive approach this one girl was taking was rather intimidating.

I'm all for campaigning but I think that this was really a step too far. Your opinions TSRians?

Wonder why they were going to vote if they didn't really know anything about them.

i got woken up by this bitch with a megaphone trying to get people to vote yes
i hate the yes campaigners who are doing this, and it only seems to the the yes campaigners at my uni, aproaching you on your way to lecturers and today my exam
and none of them have a clue?
i actually asked one of them why i should vote yes,
she came back with its fairer...
ok how so?
her response pissed me off so much "because the lib dems could get in",
i asked what makes her think that and she said they would get around the same amount of seats as labour or conservative...
ok so your voting yes so we can have more hung parliaments?
her response was just, no because one party needs 50% of the seats to lead so hung parliaments can't happen as the 2nd nd 3rd preference votes are used for this <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

i should probably note that i study politics and my lecturer had told us how hed trapped a campaigner into admitting how little they knew so i wanted a go :P

uni campuses, especially Halls should ban these people

So you completely disregarded your views on the policy and whether or not you wanted to change the way government is elected for at least a generation, and instead decided not to vote because a group of idiots annoyed you a bit?
