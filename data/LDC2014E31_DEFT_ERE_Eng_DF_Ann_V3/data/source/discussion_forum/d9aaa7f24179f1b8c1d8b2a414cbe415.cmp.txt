Um, Rick Perry is not the governor of Georgia - the state that put this man to death.

Uh, the majority of that audience that applauded for Rick Perry was not from Georgia - the state that put this man to death.

I know absolutely nothing about this case - and I seriously doubt you know much about it either, save for what you've read in your own biased sources and save for the fact that it serves as a means to aggravate your emotions and prejudices against capitol punishment and to publish here your rancor against the "ignorant right wing."

I sincerely hope no injustice was served here; I sincerely do. But this case went to jury and through the entire appeals process and made it all the way to the supreme court. THAT's what I know, and that's all I know. Period.

If that makes me a member of the ignorant right wing, so be it. Better that I say than being a member of what I can only assume would be the "enlightened left wing" - who's apparent [presumed] enlightenment knows the truth of this case without having ever been present in the courtroom or heard evidence from either side (well, save for the evidence put forth by the media...). <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/doh.gif"/>

If I could show you beyond a shadow of a doubt that they put an innocent man to death...

...what then?

Here's an interesting point to ponder. There were two executions today, Wednesday, Sept 21, 2011. One was the execution of a black man who was convicted of killing a white man. Protests abound. The other was the execution of a white man who killed a black man and the protests were all but nonexistent. Interesting indeed

How about this interesting fact: One was executed because he was guilty without a doubt, the other was executed even though 7 witnesses recanted their stories, and there was no evidence.

How about this. Both were executed after being convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. When those seven told there stories to the jury, they were under oath. When they recanted, they were not under oath. The system worked

You don't believe Police sometimes coerce people?
I generally believe Police are good, but there are dodgy ones out there.

The West Memphis Three is a good example. Fortunately their lives were spared.

So would you favor charging those 7 who recanted their testimonies with perjury?

The more I learned during my undergrad in forensic science the more I supported the death penalty. The more I learned about the legal system during law school the quicker I changed my mind.

They risked perjury to recant, so I think means something. If they were coerced, I would rather see the police officers in trouble rather than those 7. If they did commit perjury, like they are essentially admitting to, then they should get whatever's coming to them (legally speaking), however it didn't save the seemingly-innocent man.

Ot there is the possibility that those seven never committed perjury but regret playing a role in man being executed, or over the years their memories have faded. After all, this wasn't Davis' only conviction for shooting someone.

Mmmmm, Christians arguing over whether it is justified to murder someone who murdered someone. What an appealing religion.

Way to inject race into the topic <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/thumbsup.gif"/>

Do you believe this is about race?

Why are our republican friends always so preoccupied with race?

I believe he was innocent. An innocent man died in the place of a guilty man who is still out there.

</quote>
The court case was held yes, but later evidence revealed someone else committed the crime. And, that person also confessed. I too believe Troy Davis was innocent. It is an evil act to follow through on something known to be dead wrong. The man who is guilty lives while an innocent man was killed. How much innocent blood will be spilled in this land?
