Well, us sellers should see some improvement with regard to the hassles involved with non-payers once the shopping cart goes into effect site wide. At least for fixed price items. We will no longer know if someone has put an item in their cart, as no sale will be recorded until the buyer actually pays. And those "cart" items will still be available for other consumers to purchase. So, buyers will not be able to "reserve" items, while they consider whether or not to pay for them.

Some folks are not "problem" buyers, so much as high maintenance. I had a rather infrequent buyer, who apparently purchased two of my items accidentally. I presume this, as when she paid, she only remitted payment for one of the items. I sent her a message, asking if this was in fact an error, and explained that I could cancel the transaction if that was the case. No response. So, it appears I will have to file a UID to have my fee's returned to me. And I will need to manually update my inventory. So, yes, there are administrative hassles involved with these transactions. And yes...it is just part of selling retail, whether online or in a physical outlet.

Today, I received a question about an item...customer wanted to know if a bracelet I had listed at $14.50 was sterling silver.
Seriously?

Then again...It is possible the consumer just has no knowledge of the difference between "fashion" jewelry, and "fine" jewelry. So, I answered her question patiently and honestly. Even if to me...this should be a "no-brainer." And I don't even engage in the practice of being "vague" about the description of my inventory. I don't ever try to pass anything off as being other than it is. I don't need to create problems for myself, with customers feeling they were mislead. The buyers who have an appreciation for finely crafted metal work, even if it isn't "precious" metal, are the customers I cater to. The ones hoping to find real silver or gold for less than $20, are potential "problem" buyers. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/>

So far she's stiffed 14 sellers in 2 weeks &amp; still buying. Most sellers she buys multiple, from me more than a dozen auctions, many she outbid people for. Spread over 4 pages of feedback are withdrawn comments by eBay plus complaints by sellers.
I've called eBay, they promise to do something, nothing is done, she is still burning sellers.

I am sure there will be someone on here that won't like that idea, but oh well. Anyway, I checked on the "mustyann10" and that member is no longer a registered user. HOWEVER. a brand new member popped up " mistyann10" just for you members that had problems, it's worth watching.
