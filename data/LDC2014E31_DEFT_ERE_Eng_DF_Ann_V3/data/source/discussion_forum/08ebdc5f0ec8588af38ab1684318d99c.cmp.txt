What the hell is going on with aboriginals around the planet. I've just come home from a long stint in Australia thinking that aboriginals back in Canada are far better off (relatively speaking) and now we have the Red Cross out at Attawapiskat community.

In Australia you know straight away the difference as soon as you arrive in an aboriginal community. They are run down garbage everywhere with people just sitting about doing nothing. In Canada it seems no better.

Here in Yellowknife there is a reservation by the old town and you don't need to see the teepee to know you've crossed some kind of border. In an instant the houses viewed have not received a coat of paint in years. Broken down cars and skidoos litter yards and unlike the neighborhood 10 metres away they have cut down almost every tree. Whatever happened to being in tune with nature?

Addictions and sexual abuse run high. Communities in Canada and Australia outright ban alcohol in a vain effort to stem problems. Jails are filled with them and the life expectancy is much lower than the rest of both countries.

I'm getting tired of seeing it and wondering what can be done. The bleeding heart efforts have done nothing but bred a generation of people who refuse to work and blame everyone for their issues. A glaring example is the death of a small child in Australia who was electrocuted inside a wall. The family then blamed the government for the dilapidated condition of the house. I'm sure the house came with a child sized hole kicked in already.

At the same time other communities are left without proper infrastructure like Attawapiskat but as I just learnt on the news they have been allocated 80 million since 2006. Where did all the bloody money go?

I'm wondering if it's time to give these tiny outpost communities some hard choices. Either live out bush like your ancestors and be done with it or move closer to larger settlements. These communities are disgusting and a drain on the rest of us. There seems no hope in these areas. Suicide rates are sky high indicting desperation and sadness. So if the kids don't kill themselves they end up in jail and it's every ones fault other than their own.

I do understand some of the hardships in recent memory that need to overcome such as the stolen generation and residential schools. This sympathy only stretches a finite amount though.

Any ideas on what should be done because we are going nowhere and things that are being tried only breed resentment and anger. An example there is fishing rights then natives trying to sell caught fish for profit. Or the reverse racist laws that have kept me out of my field of work for five months because I'm the wrong colour. The kicker there is that my family is close to getting our status back and even then I am the wrong type of indian.... Of course ticking that aboriginal box gives me an unfair advantage over someone who is more qualified. It would be hard not to use that which leads me to feel it should be abolished as well.

My missus dislikes my hard heart attitude but I can draw so many parallels with Africa it's not good. Is there some sort of middle ground?

I don't like seeing people suffer and something needs to change but how can we go about forcing it? For many of the youth of these communities it's past breaking point.

I agree that people in Aboriginal communities need to help themselves if they are going to have a decent standard of living and helping themselves usually involves leaving the dust bowls where they live for somewhere where there is economic opportunity. Many from Aboriginal communities know that as well,they are usually the ones who have left. Unfortunately white people lecturing them on this won't change their minds, it just pisses them off.

All we can do is to protect the children as well as we can with law enforcement, health care and adequate housing, and to provide the educational opportunities for those who want to do better to do so, so that they can work out for themselves that the should leave. If the rest of them want to live miserable squalid lives, despite the efforts of the broader Australian and Canadian communities to make amens for the wrongs of the past by providing all they need to take the opportunity for a better life, then we can all go to sleep at night with a clear concience. I know I do.
