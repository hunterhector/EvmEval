Political Chic, the concept of nation rebuilding after a war worked rather well with Japan and Germany. Germany was a European nation with similar lifstyles and Japan was only a cultural difference.
But, the nations we are fighting in now are Islamic and that is a whole other scenario entirely. Cultural and issues can be overcome, but religious fundamentalism, forget it. Trying to rebuild a nation that has at its base, a religion that adovcates persecuting or killing you, simply because you are not of their religion, is a waste of time and blood. The entire region (Pakistan included) should have had a few Hydrogen bombs dropped on them, then we could have just moved on to other matters. We have shed thousands of lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and what have we accomplished?
1. We got rid of Saddam Hussein and allowed a Shia dominated government and future ally of Iran to take his place.
2. Women are now more oppressed In Iraq.
3. Christians are fleeing Iraq because of death threats and killings.
In Afghanistan, the government is trying to include aspects of the Taliban back into its fold and women are gradually headed back to being where they were under the Taliban. Closet Christians must still hide their beliefs or face death. Citizens are still being whipped and stoned.
Basically, we have only accomplished getting thousands of sons, daughters, fathers, siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins killed for nothing. What a tragic waste.

Police Actions/Undeclared Wars (except against suck-countries like Iraq in 2 wars) - don't cut -it.

Thinking esp of The Korean War.

Meant nothing - solved nothing.

Ironically Bill Clinton was the last president to use WW2 concepts to force a country to submit to authority. Clinton authorized the (indiscriminate?) bombing of Yugoslavia to force the surrender of one man.

The dimwits in Nam - LBJ, McNamara, Rusk,Westmoreland - didnt have a clue.

They all lived during WW2 -should have known what it takes. A cleary defined mission, and unconditional committment.

Born 1953 - had nightmares of serving in rice paddies................................
