This is just a depressing little rant I'm afraid

The tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Japan were of course an insane disaster, just to see a whole city washed away and destroyed, and then that the destruction of their power plant caused a nuclear meltdown and has made a populated part of Japan's north island uninhabitable for a century

The response from the rest of the world was very heartening, there have been countless benefit campaigns and I've seen about 20 benefit albums for the victims.

So far so good, people coming together from all over the world in the face of such a massive tragedy, their traditional enemies Korea and China contributed a massive proportion of the work and their resources that was needed for the cleanup. And these are countries who still have a bad feeling towards Japan during normality because of their failure to compensate victims or even admit the extent of their crimes during the Hirohito empire from the end of the 19th century until their defeat by America in 1945

Very heartening

BUT

This summer Somalia had one of it's worst famines ever, millions are still dying from starvation. The famine was caused by the weather but the reason that it has been such a massive human tragedy is because the people who are dying were barely surviving anyway.
It has been in the news that they are in the middle of one of the country's worst famines ever, Somalia is of course famous for being one of the worst places in Africa, someone like Robert Mugabe would be a step up for them because since the collapse of the government in the 90s they have been in a state of civil war
Even when there is no famine they are still a bunch of poor Africans with no food

So why no benefit albums for the Somalians? Why didn't this capture the public imagination?
It just isn't shocking a famine in Africa, Bob Geldof did that 30 years ago, it's the problem of charity manifested absolutely, starving Africans are pretty boring, everyone was shocked in the 1980s by Kevin Carter pictures of children dying and being eaten by flies and vultures so by now it's retro

The rich countries are just choosing to be 'sympathetic' and 'caring about who they like. it misses the point

Japan is the 3rd richest country in the world, behind the USA and China and they have been for a long itme

I just mean that it's horrible how people are spending their money on Japan and not the poor, it says a lot about our society. Rich country has trouble we all feel sorry for them, poor country gets in trouble, not a big deal....

It's unfortunate that the world is overpopulated and can't sustain 6 billion humans at any decent quality of life. The more populated earth becomes the less valuable individual life is. Billions of people are not living, they are existing, an absolutely miserable existence.

Call me hateful but I'll mourn the permanent loss of 100 square miles of good farm land before I mourn for 100 million suffering Africans living like animals. It sounds horrible but feeding these people is the worst thing you can do in the long run. Their quality of life will not increase, just their population. An endless circle of misery. It's like the sign down town, Don't feed the ducks, they will become dependent, overpopulate and suffer. It's time to think quality, not quantity.

i don't think there are too many people, just too many people to live in the way that we are living. We are still using 19th century models for cities and vehicles but they are out o1f date and yes, we have to many people for that model

to be honest relaxxx i do find it pretty hateful what you implied about culling african babies, call me over sensitive....

Mass media are a good mirror to show how much a life is worth or worthless for them in different parts of the world.
If there is a bomb exploding in the USA killing 20 or 30 Americans it will be all over the headlines, if 20 or 30 Libyans are killed by a NATO bomb in Libya, its less well covered in the mass media.
Thats at least racist.
