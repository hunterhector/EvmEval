I think most people are looking at this, again, without an objective analysis of the situation. Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan, can anyone give me a successful attack by al-Qaeda on the West since the intervention? Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians, quite the contrary. Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area.

In 2006, Pakistan saw 657 terrorist attacks leaving 907 people dead.
In 2007, Pakistan saw 1,503 terrorist attacks, resulting in 3,448 casualties.
In 2008, Pakistan saw 2,148 terrorists attacks, resulting in 2,267 casualties.
In 2009, Pakistan saw 2,586 terrorist attacks, that resulted in 3,021 fatalities.

Terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people. If we compare this to figure of civilian casualties (which I will go into) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed, 385 were thought to be civilians, in contrast of the Taliban/al-Qaeda's operations to kill civilians.

From a strategy perspective, in 2009 and 2010, air drones were equipped with new missiles called Small Smart Weapon (SSW) or typically known as 'Scorpion.' These missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance, including the use of small, unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets. Ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology, Bloomberg reports that 1,300 militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid-2008. The New America Foundation believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from 25% to an estimated 6%, with a total of 18 civilians killed since August 2010.

<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/22/world/la-fg-drone-strikes-20110222">http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb...rikes-20110222</a>

On the grounds of legality, according to the Geneva Convention, members of regular armed forces – involved in conflicts – are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force. The operators in Pakistan are the United States (USAF) and the Pakistani military.

So, who really murders more? Islamic fundamentalist groups total of 35,000 casualties (since 2003) or the United States' 385 casualties (since 2004)?

Hmm the real figure of civilian drone death is unkown. Its likely to be much larger than the figure you've quoted. WHo cares? If it is 30, 30 innocent people have died for no reason. If a guy went and blew up 30 people in London right now it would be on the news for months, and we'd be reminded of it for the next 100 years. Why the double standards?

It's not double standards, there's just an opportunity to save more lives albeit, at the expense of a few. You have to negate the individual if it benefits society as a whole. I'm not saying it's right, but it's the realistic and only solution to an eroding problem in the middle east.

6% means that a disproportionately small number of terrorist attacks were carried out by Muslims. Secondly, 9/11 is not the worst thing to ever happen in history. Of course it was utterly disgraceful, disgusting and wrong, but worse things have happened. Perhaps it was the most devastating terrorist attack in America, but the ones that trail behind it were mostly carried out by non-Muslims.

Secondly, and more importantly, for every American death at the hands of terrorists, even if you want to include non-Muslim ones (ie the majority), there must be thousands of deaths that America has inflicted in other countries. Though attacks on America are not justified by this, it would be foolish to think that such aggression would not have repercussions.

And so what, was going to war worth America having access to him directly? Considering that if they had of just accepted indirect access, 9/11 would never have happened?

I agree America has inflicted hundreds of 'ground zeroes' so to speak. In the last half century America has invaded 50 countries. Dropped nukes. Vietnham too just pour agent orange and other such chemicals without a care into the woods. How many civillians died there? THe amount the Americans killed in that country is way more than anything muslim terrorists have done. Whose the real big baddy terrorist eh?

I think we all know.

What?

thank you. why can't people think the same thing? if it was two american kids dad there would be media furore. I didn't see these two kids names on the news? Yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die.

That's because they are our soldiers and our fellow citizens. We aren't the ones who want to oppress fellow countrymen and use civilians as shields, while planning new ways to kill Americans. Sure, these deaths aren't great, but only a very small minority are caused by us. Most of the killings in the middle-east are muslims killing muslims. You can't pin the blame on us.
