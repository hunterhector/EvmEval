WICHITA (AP)  A Kansas judge has again refused to block a confessed abortion clinic killer from arguing in court that he should be spared a murder conviction because he believed he was saving unborn children.
Judge Warren Wilbert dealt prosecutors a setback during a hearing Tuesday. He said that until the defense decides which evidence it will present, it's difficult for him to rule out Scott Roeder's proposed defense claim in the killing of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita, Kansas, last May.

Did anybody else find this disturbing? This guy could get infront of a jury and argue that he should be let free on lesser charges because he thought he was saving unborn babies? What if I killed a woman on birth control because I thought that was killing unborn babies? Really... um I'm kind of pissed. Seriously... with all this bullshit about Harry Reid saying negro, I've actually found something to be mad about rather then just amused.

I don't see how allowing the defense to present a weak defense, that likely will hurt him more than help, would make you angry.
let them argue that evil midgets from outerspace forced him to do it, the end result will be the same, a guilty verdict.
It's a pretty far-fetched argument, just like those that argue that god or satan made me do it.
This argument even defeats any attempt to argue insanity, as to make this argument this guy proves that he knew it was wrong by arguing he was trying to prevent another wrong.
