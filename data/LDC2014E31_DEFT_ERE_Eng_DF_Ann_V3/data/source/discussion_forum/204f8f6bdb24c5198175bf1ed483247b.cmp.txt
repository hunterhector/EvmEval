Get them charged.

On 29 Dec a few years ago me and my friend were walking up the street to catch a taxi.

We had had words with a man in a nightclub earlier, he was from Nigeria, I dont remember exactly what had happened in the nightclub but I think he had come on to my friend and she turned him down and he didnt like it.

Anyway he caught up with us as we were walking to the taxi, he ended up arguing with me mainly, he went to punch me, my friend pushed me out of the way, and then he punched her in the face.

He broke her jaw in 3 places, a couple of lads were across the street and they chased him but didnt manage to catch him (they were chavs)

We went to hopsital as she was in pain and it was confirmed that she had a broken jaw, we reported it to the police and they took us in for a interview, we were interviewed seperate.

They somehow knew who we were talking about, he must have been known to them as they showed us a pic of a man and it was him.

So then we went to court, and thankfully one of the chavs had offered to be a witness as well, I was bricking it to stand up in court

But thankfully when he arrived in court too, he saw that all 3 witness'es had turned up he changed his plea to guilty

He got sent to jail for 6 months and the was being deported.

So its def worth reporting it

Again, very different circumstances to what happened to the OP's DD. A broken jaw in an unprovoked attack with independent witnesses to give evidence is very different from "bruising" following a spat in a club that's spilled out onto the street.

And I am sure the police (with the help of CCTV) will investigate any attack and decide on the outcome.

I am very very suprised by the actions of the police in this case. If a crime is committed surely they are duty-bound to investigate and prosecute, rather than just leaving it up to the victim to decide? It's up to the POLICE to check cctv - that's their job for heaven's sake. Remember the hoo-haa about the Jordan rape claim a little while back? The police questioned her even though she was adamant she didn't want to do anything about it. That's what they are supposed to do - or else surely they are just allowing people to get away with stuff due to witnesses/victins feeling vulnerable?

My friend's OH was set upon by a group of lads outside a pub in the early hours and even though he was drunk and probably behaving provocatively the police were very professional and used cctv evidence to prosecute. His attacker got 6 months and had to pay him compensation.

What they'll often do if there's been a melee outside a club and the person who has been assualted refuses to press charges, is charge the protagonists with a public order offence (if they have the CCTV or other solid evidence to back it up) usually section 4, or a more serious section 3 affray if there's a large number of people causing trouble.

I'm surprised by your second point though - normally when someone is sent to prison they don't have to pay compensation as well as they would be deemed to have no way to pay it (because they're in prison, obviously).

I think any act of violence on another person needs taking seriously. The girls would otherwise do it again and may even harm someone seriously.

My son was also subjected to an unprovoked attack in which he nearly died. Both lads went to prison "briefly" but at least they may just think twice before doing it again. Both lads had viewed a fight as part of a normal night out beforehand.

Your daughter is what we call in the trade an unreliable witness.

She got thrown out of the club for some reason. I'm sure the club will give the police full details.
She was too drunk to give an account of what happened to the police at the time - that's not a good starting point for a prosecution.
There are CCTV pictures which may well show (and you have to be prepared for this) things you would rather not see - eg daughter mouthing off.

You've only got one side of the story. I suspect that once the police have interviewed club staff, seen the CCTV and interviewed the other parties they'll come up with a less clear-cut picture of what happened. In fact, your daughter may find herself facing a prosecution for a public order offence.
