Having grown up in Beloit and witnessing what happens when the major employers bail out(Beloit Corp and Fairbanks), this is sad.

I'm not the biggest fan of what Janesville has to offer, yet my blue collar background knows first hand what happens to families when parents have to reinvent themselves career wise late in their lives.

Raised in Beloit as well and I know the affect Beloit Corp and Fairbank's closures had on the city. My grandfather worked at that Janesville plant from age 19-49. Retired. One uncle followed GM to Ft. Wayne IN and also just took retirement at a young age basically because who knows what will happen to that pension (a brain tumor also played a big role in that decision). Another uncle works at the Janesville plant currently. This has been talked about for some time though. a few years ago it was pretty well known that there was less than 5 years at that plant. Hopefully people took that warning and have at least considered life afterwards.
