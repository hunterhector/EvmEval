Hey! I don't usually post here, so hello! I have a question regarding the VA loan my husband and I used last year to purchase our current home for 255,000. Have any of you used a VA loan to buy a house, then received a lot of streamline refinancing letters saying you'll save a bunch by refinancing? The letters all sound too good to me, as we'd save a couple hundred each month, so I keep thinking they must be too good to be true. If you have used the VA loan, and then refinanced using the streamline program, I'd be thrilled to hear about it! Thanks so much, and I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend!

We used the VA loan to purchase our house in 2008 and refinanced using the VA streamline refi last year through the bank that currently holds our mortgage. We never considered any of those bulk mail ones we get in the mail---they all seem to shady to me and often have incorrect info in them. We felt safer and easier going through our regular institution.
Pros were easy to start the process, got a rate reduction of 1.125% without needing an appraisal or equity, and saved enough per month that we paid off the closing costs in less than a year. The notary came to our house and closing was easy peasy. We saved close to $300 a month.
Cons: you have to pay the 0.5% funding fee. TONS of paperwork and needing military information again, plus it took a long time to close (but I think that was our banks fault, not that of it being a VA refi).
