Minx- this is hard on you. By now, you've went over every inch of his upbringing with a toothcomb in your head, wondering what you did that may have been wrong. You've niggled at everything to see if you could have done any different. I'm not being accusuory, and I'm hoping this comes out right, as barring my husband, I've never really talked about this.

An old boyfriend of mine sounded a lot like your son. I'd been with him for a couple of years, and thought we were getting on alright. Then one night when I'd travelled an hour to his house to see him- I got asked to go home, f off, he didn't want to see me again. All because I'd asked him how he was.

Very familiar... that wasn't nice for you x

We'd dealt with our problems- or so I thought- when we decided to take a holiday which led into living away from home for a while. At this stage, he had a dependancy on alcohol, and had been diagnosed with severe depression. I still thought I could help him. I'm not inferring anything about your son by that- simply that was my ex's state.

I'll not go into the rest of the story, as it got fairly ugly for quite a while, and really isn't relevant to you. It's enough to say I left after I was punched in the head while driving- almost lost control of the car- and he didn't seem to realise he'd even done anything.

Once ES did hit me... but he always claims he didn't... as he described a 'red mist' and still says he can't remember it..it was many years ago, but not forgotten.

I've rambled a bit, and on the verge of losing what I was saying, I think. My ex's mother forgave everything he did- all the fights, alcoholic rants, shouting and swearing- and the end result was even more anger directed at her, as he felt he wasn't being taken seriously. I used to sit up with her in the early hours of the morning, and she'd tell me to leave him, as it was breaking her heart watching how he treated other people. Yet, he could be sweet, jolly, full of laughter around other people. She tried so hard to help him, with money, support- and in the end, it's destroyed her.

The poor lady... good advice.. not to let that happen here.

I watched her suffer badly from continually trying to talk to him and help him- however bad it gets, don't let your son do this to you. Be strong as others have advised- and step back.

Thank you so much for that, it's hard, but for a short moment today I thought- if I begged &amp; begged, and he came back, he'd easily do this again. I'd be walking on eggshells, afraiad to say a word out of line... and he could even do it once he has children.
So I'm not going to... I need to learn to carry on and block the hurt out, and to help with that i've started writing a blog... I never thought this was a common thing until I recieved some supportive replies on here- so sad.

really appreciate your message, thank you xx

I don't have kids, but I've worked with children with (alleged) mental health problems, and their parents. Usually it's the parents bringing their badly behaved brats along, claiming they have ADHD and wanting them medicated, because they lack the parenting skills to impose even the most basic of discipline on their offspring.

It's that attitude that their little darlings can do no wrong, if there is a problem with their behaviour then it must be ADHD, or it must be the school's fault, or it must be the victim's fault, or anybody's fault except the parents who raised the little thug themselves.

Dear lord! I don't want to go off topic, but I can't help thinking that if I did have a child with that type of issues, I pray and hope that the people I turned to for help would be more understanding than you appear to be!

Not saying that is even remotely the case with the OP, but you wanted to know the background I was coming from.

Well, maybe not in so many words, but exactly what are you saying then...? I'm not surprised you haven't got kids, I bet you would be slightly less judgemental if you had actually experienced real 24-7 parenting...

The original poster had two sons start university in the same year (see the first post), so that graduation cake could be for the other son.
