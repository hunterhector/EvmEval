Come on, you're 42 years old (that surprised me, I thought you'd be in your early twenties) you really should know better than to fall for these kind of lines.

You would think that with age we mature, and you would think we wouldn't fall for the same lines but we do... men and women time and time again will continue to do so. Because when it comes to affairs of the heart life really is seen through a different pair of spectacles.. And until you take them off or someone else does it for you,you aren't going to be able to see the wood for the trees..

Not badly enough, it would seem since he's so very willing to inflict the same misery upon his own children. This comment of his, alone, ought to make you see that he is an utter hypocrite. I took it to mean that he would not leave his wife while the children were still of school age, as far as I'm aware there was no adultery involved with his own parents marriage break up.

Course, he's probably just the same as many adulterers/cheats who believe they're so clever that they'll never get caught.

Will your daughter's studies and life remain placid if sonnyboy's wife founds out, chucks him out and he moves in with you in desperation? That wouldnt happen because I wouldnt allow him to

Do you know what he's doing the other two or three weeks between his visits? You have had your sexual health checked out, haven't you no I don;t feel i need to...?

This is not fictional, its a marriage that has recently split up, the wife just wanted nothing at all to do with the husband, she wouldn't even kiss him good bye in the morning, stopped even just having a smile or a warm word for him, no matter what he did, and believe me, he did try everything, took her out, took her away, no matter what he did, she refused to acknowledge there was a problem, as far as she was concerned, this was how it was going to be, and from what he says, it was a gradual thing, she never used to be so cold.

He tried everything he could, and she just pushed him further and further away, till in the end he walked out.

Even now the marriage is over, she's still very cold towards him, although she has now got herself another man.

Sudden or gradual change? You've changed the story. Sounds like the wife knew the marriage was over long before the husband did, but was too much of a coward to say so. I genuinely don't see what your point is, are you trying to suggest they would both have been better off if he had a discrete affair rather than left her? Surely they both now have the opportunity to build a happy future for themselves?

IMO a good man with a failed marriage is a lot better 'catch' than a married man. When I am in a loving relationship I want to shout my feelings from the rooftops, for my friends and family to love them as much as I do. And those who have loved me have been exactly the same. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/sport-smiley-001.gif"/> That is incompatible with being the 'other woman'.

Just because I am having a relationship with a married man does not make me a slapper. He is the only man I have been to bed with in 5 years and I currently have no concerns whatsoever about my sexual health.

Unless you've been tested you can't possibly be sure.

Essentially, you've had unprotected sex with everyone anybody you've ever had unprotected sex with has had unprotected sex with, and anybody they had unprotected sex with too, if you follow me. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/wink.gif"/>

Plenty of STIs are symptomless, and there are some that even condoms don't protect against. You almost certainly have HPV at the very least.

I put the thread up because I really did want some opinions, whether they be good or bad. I am due to see him this week and I have been thinking for a while whether I can continue with the situation I'm in. Not because I have any doubt about the feelings that are involved, but because I miss him a lot between the times I see him and although we phone and text daily, this isn't really enough anymore I don't think.

Has this helped you at all?
