I am of course referring to America, the Federal Reserve and the banking cartel Oligarchs. There is certainly an "evil" elitism going on in the world right now. Rome has an elite. It is called the Vatican. We have the Tory party <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/p.gif" alt=":p:"/>

But was the Ayatollah right?

Is our government the most "evil" in the world?

Our government seems to put banks, big business and capitalism before the needs of the people (assuming that they do not need rampant capitalism and huge superstores). We bailed out the elite bankers with tax payers money and now the big businesses are sacking folk.

We (not I) work for a ruling elite. We are, some would say, slaves on our own land. Although slaves don't get a wage, we are payed a pittance for hard work. Now they want us to work for free!!

We were taken to war with an imaginary foe. It was merely for America's need for oil. There were no WMDs, and the government duped the people into believing that U.S. style democracy would be good for the Middle East. We tortured our prisoners of war. We shut up and shut out those who dared to speak out. We consored and we covered over, and sexed up the truth. Our government no longer listens to the people they were elected by. Our government is more concerned with international affairs; trying to sort out the affairs of other countries whilst leaving our own to rot away. Our people are lost for want of leadership. Our children are laid waste and desolate. (Sorry if I sound like Isaiah here).

The government have brought in more than a hundred laws since the terrorist attacks. The issue over who caused the 9/11 attacks will always prompt conspiracy theorists to speculate that the U.S. government was behind it all to shore up American solidarity in their "war on oil" with the Middle East.

Are we the "evil" ones here? I sometimes wonder. Then there is the EU. Now, there's a candidate for "evil" if there ever was one! Nation shall rise against nation, as the saying goes.

Aren't we now in a culture war, a religious war, an economic war, a social war, an internal war, a political war?

When you look at it we are at war right now, and many of us do not know. This war is unlike any gone before.

Was the Ayatollah right?

No Poll included.

No it isn't. It's like calling a parent that slaps their child the worst parent in the world when there are parents who have tortured, starved and raped their children. The fact of the matter is our government was dubbed the most evil in the world when there are over 100 countries that are worse, therefore making the statement stupid.

Sorry fast coach!

I thought you were arguing that through other governments being more evil, ours can justify being evil, while staying less evil than the other evil governments who may commit crimes more evil and accidently a whole human rights.

How on earth is calling our government the most 'evil' in the world justified?, we've hardly said anything about the election results and deliberately kept fairly quiet over it. If i was David Miliband i'd criticise him back, make a statement calling him an unelected fascist dictator and denounce the deaths of protestors as 'barbaric', then withdraw all British diplomats.

Perhaps i'm not cut out for Diplomacy though <img src="images/smilies/redface.png"/>
