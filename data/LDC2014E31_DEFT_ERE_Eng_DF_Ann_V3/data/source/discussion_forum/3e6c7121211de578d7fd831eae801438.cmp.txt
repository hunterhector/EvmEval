The argument of the fanatics of the gun lobby is, whether overtly made, or inferentially, that they need weapons to protect themselves from the tyranny of the government, and that this was the intent of the second amendment.
</quote>

Well, the primary motivation of the Framers was based on the premise that with a strong militia there would be no need for a standing army. They had the notion that a militia could never be tyrannical, and a standing army would probably lead to tyranny.

However, there was a bit of a notion of the militia providing a last ditch defense against tyranny if it came to that.

In 1939, an appeal was made to the Supreme court by a representative of the Justice Department after an idictment was quashed against two men for transporting a sawed-off shotgun. In The United States versus Miller, the Court held:

<quote>
In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.

A good ruling.

I wish they'd start enforcing it.

The Supreme Court has never comprehensively reviewed the application of the IInd amendment.

What about the above Miller Ruling?

<quote orig_author="Setanta">
Further, in The United States versus Miller, the Court suggested that there might be a standard for determining what constitute the arms of the militia, although they did not delve further into what that might be.
</quote>

I think they did far more than suggest it.

<quote orig_author="Setanta">
So far, case law with the Supremes holds that states may regulate the militia and their arms, and prohibit armed bodies outside their regulatory code.
</quote>

Actually, I think it would be up to Congress to decide the arms, although the courts should be able to step in if Congress chose something inappropriate.

<quote orig_author="Setanta">
Quite apart from the appalling poor performance of militia in the history of the United States, there is no good reason to believe that any state ever has or ever will allow citizens to arm themselves as they choose and associate in armed bodies at their own discretion.
</quote>

However, hopefully we will someday return to the Constitution and have the states actually set up militia under government control, which people could join if they wished to.

<quote orig_author="Setanta">
Whatever may please Oralloy has no bearing upon what regulation the states may enact, and whether or not the Supreme Court will permit such regulation.
</quote>

Well on the Supreme Court thing, my statements are in line with the Constitution, and the Supreme Court has a fairly good track record of eventually returning to the Constitution when they have departed from it, so there may come a day when they will rule that way.

And until then we have the NRA to fight gun legislation in Congress.

It's a dream, and a sick and dangerous dream at that.

I don't see what is sick or dangerous about dreaming of having the Constitution followed.

If the Supreme court decided a law was constitutional then how can it be unconstitutional?
</quote>

By violating the Constitution.

The Supreme Court does not get to rewrite the Constitution. If they make an illegitimate ruling in support of an unconstitutional law, the government will have free rein to violate the Constitution until such time as the Supreme Court reverses their ruling, but it does not change the fact that the Constitution is being violated throughout this time.

"Separate but equal" is a good example of this. The Supreme Court issued bogus rulings that allowed the government to do unconstitutional segregation for many years. The fact that the Supreme Court allowed it does not change the fact that it was a blatant violation of our Constitution.

So, you don't support enforcing the laws then oralloy. You only support enforcing those you don't disagree with, those laws you don't think violate the constitution.

The legal rulings don't matter. Only your personal opinion does. A fool's game that allows you to pretend to want to follow the law at the same time you are more than willing to ignore it.

I'd hardly characterize "support for our Constitution" as a fool's game....

The fool's game is deciding solely on your own about what is constitutional without reference to the constitutional manner in how constitutionality is decided.
