Quite right!

These 'campaigners' who were so opposed to this scheme were made up of far left socialist workers party clowns and communists.
Little do they know they're far left utopia only works if the whole world is in it too.

We have to compete with China and other countries where children are so driven to better themselves and learn that on a documentary I saw the kids were begging their parents to fund extra education out of school time, so the parents were working all hours god sends and the kids were in class all hours god sends in the evening after school and on Saturday and Sunday.

They will work for nothing and will be glad of the experience. That is what we're up against and must compete on a global scale. What these Trotskyists don't understand is that giving young people the chance to gain skills and experience that will benefit them and us as a society isn't oppression but common sense and doing them a favour.

How do these Trotskyists think we generated our wealth in the first place? It certainly wasn't from the attitude of lazy entitlement that they promote. It was bloody hard work and working for free to gain experience is a good thing. Anyway they aren't working for free as they are being paid benefits! They have no alternative suggestions to improve things; just block any sensible attempt to sort out the problem and continue scraping along at the bottom with the current failling status quo.

So should people who've been out of work for years (some families have 3 generations where they have NEVER worked!) continue living off the backs of those who pay for their benefits without any obligation to offer anything in return?! That's morally right is it?!

Thankfully the silent majority are overwhelmingly in favour of this plan and the opposition are a minute fringe pressure group way out of touch with most of the population.

The Trotskyist's obsession with evil big business exploiting the poor worker is way off the mark!

We're almost completely bankrupt as a country because greedy unions and other lazy far left communist organisations have pushed our wages so high that we're uncompetitive globally. The Chinese will glady take the work at a price we refuse to work for! Look at our manufacturing industry.

That's why their country is booming and ours is going down the toilet. Thanks Trotskyists!

The opening statement you quoted is a fact I'm afraid.

It's all very well dismissing statements as discriminatory if they are wildly inaccurate but it kind of defeats your point if it is true!

you're joking of course. i mean, i know you probably are, but sometimes you have to proclaim it because there really are people that one-dimensional out there!

As for "I think I speak for the vast majority when I say we don't want your discriminating kind here". What is this the 50's?!

All you've done is copied what I've said because my thinking was sharper, and it doesn't even make sense the way you've used it.

I know what you're trying to do, but you should aim it at someone who takes the bait.
