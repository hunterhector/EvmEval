There has to be a present risk of harm, editec. Reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on first amendment rights are constitutional, but only if they pass muster on this point.

And those already existing time place and manner restrictions were utilized at Matthew Snyder's funeral, with the result that the family never even knew WBC was there. So why do we need broad new restrictions on speech, or liability expanded for speech, when existing restrictions already work ?

Apparently the restrictions did not work as harm was done. It was proven in a lower court by a judge. Granted that was overruled in a higher court, that is how we got here. I highly doubt the Supreme Court took this case, only to agree with the appeals decision. A narrow ruling with a ban on political speech focused on a private individual without a political opinion on the speech in question does no harm. In this case, the soldier was the private individual and could not speak in his own defense. I think something about private events that have no reasonable expectation of being completely out of the public might be part of it.

I'm not so sure. To my knowledge IIED hasn't been expanded anywhere to cover knowing and voluntary viewing of offensive material in the media or online, but with all the tort cases out there it's hard to say for sure. I'm uncomfortable with it though, for a lot of reasons.

The example of defacing a memorial site that Gadawg brought up is one thing, that's essentially vandalism of another person's property and the parents would be viewing it unawares. But what about when the "victim" voluntarily seeks out a site knowing in advance the content will be offensive and then claims millions because he was in fact offended?

There are a couple other problems with this argument. The first is the sufficiency of the evidence, which was considered so vital on appeal it caused a split in the bench not over whether the evidence was sufficient but whether they could rule it was insufficient on an amicus waiver (read the 4th Circuit ruling). The second being that the question of whether the speech was protected, a question of law, was given to the jury - which is only to determine questions of fact. The judge is to hear arguments and determine all questions of law. That alone pretty much guarantees this will be remanded for either summary judgment or retrial - under what instructions is what remains to be seen.

The court has both liberal and conservative points to make. The opinions will be interesting. The church is going to lose.

Tough case, but privacy and harassment enter the picture too.
