DH leaves tonight for work travel. Five hours later my mother's flight lands.
I love my mother but am "hopefully optimistic" the visit goes well. When she came to visit in Italy after BabyD was born, she was there for five weeks and was not helpful. Definitely a guest that required being taken care of. The visit was so rough that after she left I called home to let my dad know to never send her to me for that long again without my permission, and then I didn't call home for over a month. When she came to Bahrain a year ago the demonstrations started, I was working, and she was stuck in the house almost the entire time. When I flew back home, six months pregnant, for my brother's wedding, the second thing she said to me was to gleefully announce that I looked fat. She has a broken wrist that is healing slowly and still requires prescription pain management.
But.... She apparently wants to cook for me this time. Just can't lift anything of much weight or open cans so I'll have to help. She has some work training coursework she is bringing so there's some built in down time. She's been here before so it's not a complete shock. I'm not going back to work until after she leaves so we can actually do things. I have a list of things for us to do even if we accomplish only one thing a day. And I am now stocked up on alchohol for me and have a supply of milk in the freezer for DD.

Good luck... gotta love the people who insist on "helping" you when it could be easier to do it yourself... Not like you can just play with the kids while she cooks dinner...
Hope you get through your list!

Sunday night and then goes to work the next day.
What's funny is that my mom's trip was planned before his work trip. He comes home one day with "I'm sorry" written all over his face. I give him the one eyebrow up look and he tells me about this trip. He knew that even though it wasn't his fault he was in trouble.

Poor you, and poor DH, he knows he's in trouble with you for not being there, but he still gets to come home to your mom on Sunday. Mostly poor you though!!! Sending you many coping-with-mom-vibes!

If it will make you feel better I can always drink with you via the Nest. Then you won't be drinking alone in endurance.

Good luck!

I know it's not funny and that you are frustrated, but I am laughing so hard at this. My mother was here for the birth of the twins that she didn't want to miss - and during my scheduled c-section she was on a Thames river cruise. They spent more time touring London than seeing us and the twins. And for them to make a meal? God no.
MIL has come a few times - the most recent to specifically help out while I was in the hospital. Poor DH nearly sent her back on a plane after day 2. For the month that she was here she was helpful while I was away and for about 2 or 3 days after I got back... and then she phoned it in and we had to clean up after her more than the kids!
I would let her make dinners, but keep frozen pizzas as back ups. Greatly lower your expectations, etc. and just enjoy the visit with the woman that revels in your supposed fat-ness. (my mother told me last night that my house was "un-livable". After I took great offence she "kindly" explained that it was because the carpets are horrilbe, there is mould, the kitchen is horrendous and the bathroom is horrible - she would NEVER have rented that place. And then she went on about how I'm "too sensitive".)
Enjoy helping your mother make you dinner!
