The well is all but killed, the oil has dispersed, sank, or is suspended below the surface, beaches and fishing grounds are reopening. Nothing to see here- move along folks.

People still care about what happened, I do. but I agree lets hear about some other news as well. It looks like it can be brought under control now that it's capped.

I still can't believe they capped it under all that water. Amazing really.

yuo: like all other distraction addicts are detached from reality: you have this idiotic idea that the moment your national news media stops looking at a story: that story vanishes. 'poof' disappears: just because they don't show it to you.

It is still happening: it will not stop happening for 100 years. The unseen poisons of the toxins of Corexit dropped into the ocean plus the millions of gallons of oil and mehane are killing untold numbers of living dolphions, fish, crabs, birds, shrimp. The entire Caribbean ocean has been poisoned. Oil is washing up north of Miamui beach on the EAST side of Florida. The oil slicks under the surface are still moving and poisoning not only the Gulf Ocean, but the Atlantic Ocean also... this is a continuing event of death and poison touching and spreading.

The dispersant BP is using to hide the oil it is responsible for cleaning: is 200 times more toxic to fish and wildlife than the oil itself. It is a cancerous poison which is just as deadly as radiactive poisonous toxic waste. It kills slowly and remorselessly.

Just because you don't see the spread of the oil doesn't mean it stops happening.

Oil in Miami Beach? Haven't heard about that. I've got a family member there right now. He didn't see any either. The beach was full though.

The entire Caribbean poisoned? Hardly.

Has anyone noticed the media blackout going on in the Gulf?

</quote>

Yes, the conventional media. There are all sorts of independent media reporting on the story, but that's not something that fits anyone's agenda.

So much for Faux Nooz being "biased." One would think they would run with the story, but they haven't.

So here's the story:

It's a big mess and needs some big cleanup.

It's not the catastrophe that was reported and fishing boats are heading back out.

The biggest problem now is the stigma that the entire Gulf is ruined and all beaches are 3 feet deep in oil muck so generally people are avoiding the entire area. Good for Ft. Lauderdale I guess - not sure why that Obama stronghold gets to win over the other Obama stronghold of St. Petersburg, but I think that's what happens when the government says it's going to pick favorites....

The last time something like this happened that I know of; was the republican convention in New York for the renomination of Bush Jr for a second term in office.

</quote>

What do mean? I was there.

<quote orig_author="turak">
You were at the republican convention in New York in 1992? Horseshit. Otherwise you would know what I am talking about.

</quote>

No, I was there in 2004 when George W. Bush (aka "Jr.") was nominated for a second term. George H. W. Bush, son of Prescott Bush was never called "Bush Jr."

Your idea of a 'stigma' makes me vomit: your idea that a part of the globe can be destroyed and you will escap all effects of that glabal disaster is the insulated arrogance which comes from freaks married to machines hiding in isolation chambers behind closed door in tiny rooms. Your generation of machine distraction addiction addicts will not last long in America. When your entire natioion is covered in oil and you are thankfully dead from its poison: we will be free of infantile assholes who treat a global disaster as if it doesn't exist.

</quote>

Wow. Hyperbole much? I most certainly did not treat the disaster as if it doesn't exist. Looks like you're just bitter that the situation is improving rapidly. As to "my generation," I think you are ignorant since you don't even know which generation I'm in.

tar balls were found on Coca beach north of Miami: North of Miami: not in Miami
the Gulf stream goes along the shore: it does not travel against the shore: if you went a few miles offshore Miami beaches: you would find the oil. This is now totally blase all of you are: as long as it doesn't wash ashore on your feet: hey, forget it. why are even here on an environment form?
