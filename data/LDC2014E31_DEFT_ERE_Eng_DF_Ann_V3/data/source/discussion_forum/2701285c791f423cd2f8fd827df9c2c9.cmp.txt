In an attempt to answer what I think you're question really is. A lot of people aren't aware of these things but, for the JFK assassination...there was an actual government commission that in fact said there was likely a conspiracy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_...Assassinations</a>

Also Martin Luther King,again many people are unaware of this, but his family won a civil lawsuit saying there was indeed a conspiracy to kill MLK. <a href="http://actofstate.org/">http://actofstate.org/</a> I think the fact that his own family doesn't even believe the official story is pretty telling. I hope this is something like the answers you were looking for.

The HSCA's case rests on the acoustic evidence which was recorded after the assassination so they really have no case at all.

As for King, a civil suit isn't the same thing as a criminal charge, for which no agency could ever find any evidence against Lloyd Jowers. They must be in on it too. Then why did they let the civil suit proceed? Ohh they are clever.

I don't really care what King's family thinks. There are plenty of mothers in the world who don't believe their sweet little boys could ever grow up to be axe-murderers either but that don't make it so.

I do not think it is the same.....I am presuming John Albert reserves the tern "Conspiracy Theory" for nutty unverifiable stuff. Gladio is a different story so I am imagining that he would call it something else, though I do not know that for a fact, as obviously once upon a time "Gladio" was a "conspiracy theory" in the pejoritive sense of the term, with only a courageous lone Italian judge as its proponent, simply wondering and speculating and then of course ultimately bringing down the house, but that would be later.

Most utlimately proven to be true bona fide false flag operations, must start out as some guy's "nutty idea", some guy's ridiculous conspiracy theory.

Your "courageous lone Italian judge" uncoverd Gladio as part of a criminal investigation, not because of a "conspiracy theory".

Even assuming a conspiracy theory were true it isn't likely to be proven by a conspiracy theorist. The mindset works against the kind of patient evidence gathering and careful investigation required to break something like Watergate. They are always looking for the 'smoking gun', that one piece of perfect evidence that will blow the other side away. If they think they have one they latch on to it for dear life and refuse to let go even when they're shown to be embarrassingly wrong; discrediting themselves and whichever conspiracy they're advocating in the process.

Watergate was silly, that was no crime......Big deal, Nixon was capable of and in fact did do plenty worse in 6th grade during recess.....

He was the man though, it was for the most part one guy against many.....Not that he had no help, but it was one guy's vision/insight that made this happen, one guy against some low life NATO thugs.....

A criminal investigation was a big part in the uncovering of Watergate...

My point is not that your description of Gladio is wrong. It is certainly correct. My point is that it is so different from the other things that this term describes that you can't can't use the same term for both of them.

Gladio was a conspiracy. This is true. It was a clandestine government black op. This is true. It was covert. This is true. But to call it a a Conspiracy Theory that was in fact true would be wrong. It was never denied by anyone. Its mechanisms are well understood. People involved in it are obvious. Once it was in the open, its mechanism became apparent to anyone with the appropriate background. We're certainly not sitting her 10 years later arguing about whether or not it happened.

So it may be a conspiracy in Patrick-talk, but what's the word we're going to use for 9/11 Truth? And if it's not "conspiracy theory", you're going to have to go around and ask millions of people to stop using the term.

The conspiracy to get Ward Churchill fired for dissenting from Bush's post-9/11 propaganda. Circumstantially evident almost immediately and ultimately proven to the satisfaction of a jury. Still quite difficult for a lot of people to accept.

I am quite unfamiliar with this case. The Great Wiki states Churchill sued for wrongful dismissal and won. What does that have to do with anything here? It appears to me this is clearly a procedural dispute.
