The "fight" was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS....IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE.

WTF are YOU babbling about?

Why do you hate America so much?

Are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon/teabagger BS? Or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon/teabagger cousin's stupidity?

In America we have a thing called Due Process. We do not approve of Lynch-Mobs. I know that bothers you Socialists/Progressives, but that's the way it is. So get over it.

Hey genius, "due process" includes PROPER POLICE PROCEDURE....that means you DO NOT just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning, drug/alcohol test. The call for justice is a call for Zimmerman to be arrested, not "lynched".

Intellectually dishonest libertarians/neocons/teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life....but the FACTS will always be your undoing. Carry on.

The only person in this process whose due process rights are a concern are George Zimmerman's, are you trying to argue the police are railroading him? If not, stop talking about due process.

You don't believe in Due Process? Man, you Socialists/Progressives really are lost. Maybe America isn't the place for you? May i suggest China or North Korea? Bon Voyage. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Due Process begins with proper police procedure, you stupe. As it's evident, the cops in that area didn't even do that! A matter of history, a matter of fact that...which now requires scrutiny by other forces (state and possibly federal).

But do continue to babble like a good little neocon/teabagger/libertarian flunkie....it would be funny if it weren't so pathetic. Carry on.

Those idiots can only think of one answer to the question because anything else would spoinl their attempt to make this a race issue.

The reason that it took so long is that the Sanford Police investigated the incident and determined that Zimmerman's story checked out and they released him. That should have been it but the parents of the boy weren't satisfied and then ONLY because Treyvon is black and they thought Zimmerman was white, did it become a major story. Now that it is, Gov.Scott is placating the hysterical lynch mob by having someone look into it. the fact that after all that, Zimmerman is still a free man today makes me suspect that Zimmerman's story still checks out. Mind you, it is only speculation on my part.

Please stop treating your supposition and conjecture as fact.

It took the PARENT of Martin 3 days before they got the word from the local police dept. as to what happened to their missing kid. Zimmerman was NEVER taken down to a precinct for an OFFICIAL questioning DESPITE being involved in a fatal shooting. He still hasn't to this day.

No decent foresnics.

WTF is that all about?

If it were NOT for the due diligence of local black media (and then national black media) along with Progressive radio stations, the Main Stream Media would have kept this story on the back burner....hell, Fox News was STILL the last one to catch on with coverage AFTER the Big 3 started coverage.

Gov. Scott is involved because of the PRESSURE brought by the various groups and the (now) national media examination.

Try dealing with the FACTS instead of your wishful thinking.

Zimmerman was taken into custody, and released after the police determined they had no probable cause.

Really? Prove it! Because to date he was NOT given a blood alcohol test, foresnics as to the ballistics from his gun, nor was the 911 tape brought into question as to WHY did he pursue and confront Martin when he told not to. So beyond a quick Q&amp;A, what the hell happened? Was his gun even confiscated? (and how the hell does a guy with a record get a CCWP?)

As for the forensics, do you think the world works like CSI? Most of the crap they show is impossible half the rest is junk science, and half of the real stuff they show won't hold up in court. Most police departments can't do a fraction of the forensics that actually exists, so the police screwing it up is not part of some massive conspiracy.

Who said anything about the CSI program, genius. Standard ballistic test to determine powder residue on victims and perps hands has been around for a LONG time, and is available to even the most remote precinct/station. If they don't have it on the premises, they can send it to a regional one that does.....and remember, it's was OVER A MONTH before the "main stream media" picked this up, which is MORE than enough time for proper police work to have taken place.

Why don't you start dealing with the facts before you try lecturing others.
