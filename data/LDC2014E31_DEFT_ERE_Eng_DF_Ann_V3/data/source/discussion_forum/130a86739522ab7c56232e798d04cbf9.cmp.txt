[QUOTE=make me wise;44480052]Did anyone; family, friends, teachers etc ever praise you as a child OP? Not just when you achieved something, but along all the little steps it took to acomplish something. My view is that you dont seem to look at how much you have achieved and feel a sense of pride in yourself.

Actually no, they didn't. My mum wanted me to achieve a lot and I was a straight A student, from school year 1 up until graduation from University. She used to say that for me to get a B is worse than to get a D. So I guess I am indeed a perfectionist.

Sadly, my mum has passed away already a few years back (as has my dad), both in their early fifties. And I think the reason I am trying so hard might be because they would expect me to do well in life so I am still trying to make them proud. To be perfectly honest, it is killing me to think that I am not living up to my mum's expectations, whatever they were.

Can I ask OP, what sort of wealth did your family have growing up? Is this a case of not having much and trying to build it all up in one generation? Or is it a case of trying to match the level of your parents but with different incomes?

I went to a state school but it was selective. I come from a middle-class family but after my parents divorced life became more difficult financially. We were never poor as such but it was difficult for mum. SInce then I am terrified of having no money. So the mere thought of having savings in the bank makes me feel content.

I guess that's part of the reason why we did so well saving up 90K.

Then this is what you need help with. Go get counselling, I am sure that your parents would have been proud of you whatever you acheived, only it looks like they never got a chance to tell you this.

I reckon this is the issue you need help with. When you have paid your mortgage you are still going to feel this way unless you get some help for your feelings.

When you get your £500k house, it'll still not be good enough because you have these unresolved issues. Sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear but I think you need counselling to deal with your parents death and their assumed expectations.

I really don't understand people who have children, then insist that the children must have the best of everything, so work all the hours under the sun and moon in order to pay for *the best* when the really best thing for those children is quality time spent with their parents.

Children are only children for such a very short time and they don't need holidays in florida, private education and all the other trappings that *the Jones'* have.
What they NEED, is a parents undivided attention. Time to take them to the park, bake cakes, go splashing in puddles and days out at the seaside.

OP, you have your values and priorities wrong. There has been a lot of very good advice given to you, I really hope you take it, for the sake of your health and especially for the sake of your children.
