Newt Gingrich is a stupid person's idea of what a smart person sounds like. I think it was Paul Krugman who said that, and I like it.

Gingrich is also a pathological liar. He lied about his role with Freddie Mac and every time he is caught in a lie, he tells another one. And he took an active part in destroying the economy by helping the GSEs defend themselves when some members of Congress were trying to unwind them.

He's a gigantic hypocrite as well. While he was excoriating Bill Clinton for cheating on Hillary, and made it a special point to say he was going to bring up Monica Lewinsky every chance he got, he himself was cheating on his own wife.

On top of all that, he is corrupt. He was the first Speaker of the House in history to be fined. He was caught lying to Congress. Again, while he was trying to impeach Clinton for lying. He left his job in disgrace.

And now... <a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-09/romney-s-bain-capital-leadership-attacked-as-exploiting-companies-for-cash">he's going the full Marxist</a> route of attacking creative destruction.

Those of us who believe in free markets and those of us who believe that, in fact, the whole goals of investment is entrepreneurship and job creation, would find it pretty hard to justify rich people figuring out clever, legal ways to loot out a company, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, yesterday, ahead of the states Jan. 10 presidential primary.

Mitt Romney is not a capitalist, Tyler said. He is a predatory corporate mugger. If you ever wonder why so many manufacturing jobs are overseas, you need to look no further than Mitt Romney. He can claim thousands of jobs created, only those jobs were created in Mexico and Southeast Asia.

Neocons have been mistaking the elephant's shit for the elephant. It is time to sweep Newt into the dustbin.

You're getting your position on other people's intelligence from Paul Krugman. 'Nuff said.

I don't think that anyone has "killed it" in the debates.

I think Newt has been the most accurate and forthright. He has been married 3 times, currently for 13 years to Calista, and I respect the fact that, in spite of political consequences, he has been divorced 2 times, rather than having a sting of lovers, while married to one woman, as so many other politicians try to get away with. I like Newt because I trust Newt. He is the least PC of them all, thus far, and in my opinion.

Justin Quinn: "Gingrich has been married three times, and he has been accused of having a multitude of extramarital affairs, although he has only admitted to one -- with the woman who would eventually become his third and present wife."

Newt has been neither forthright or accurate. The constant stream of Pinocchios he has gotten from the Washington Post, on easily checked facts, demonstrates this.

.....And, managed to lower the bar, so far, even Mitt Romney.....

I'm not a huge fan, but I have to give credit where credit is due and he's wiping the floor with the republican field in these debates. I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses. He definitely offers the most substance in his replies, but a lot gets lost in translation. Romney is a milquetoast douchewagon who can't even give a straight answer to a simple question like 'do the states have the right to ban contraception?'

Get used to the idea of 4 more years of the Oh-Boy. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

Did Manifold say Obama was wiping the field with the Republicans in the debates? Um... does he know that Obama isn't debating the Republicans?

Krugman got the Nobel prize for economics, not peace. However, he's still an idiot. Put him in a room with any halfway intelligent free market economist and he turns into a blubbering moron. I've seen some debates where Krugman's opponent had him practically in tears.
