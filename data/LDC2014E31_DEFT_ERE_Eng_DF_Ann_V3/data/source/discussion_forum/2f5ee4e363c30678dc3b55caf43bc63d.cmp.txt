It was reported on the ABC News that the special ops were Navy Seals Team 6...the same team that got Bin Ladin. A real national tragedy.

I don't know if there is one already but I propose a very public memorial erected for these best of the best and bravest of the brave that have fallen.

The anti-military left has some diehards in Code Pink that are pissed at Obama for not surrendering to Al Qai'da, but many of the left-wing goons put down their pitchforks because they feel protesting Obama will hurt their overall socialist agenda with non-military issues.

They are willing to sit on their hands for Obama in order to ruin our economy and society.

If this happened on Bush's watch we would have anti-war protestors on TV and marching around the USA, but not a peep with the "holy one" sitting in the White House.

There won't be a PR TV moment for Obama with this news story connected to Navy SEALs.

This is true. I've always said the "Anti-War Left" are by far the biggest frauds in America. Where are all those 'Human Shields' they sent over to save Saddam Hussein? Not seeing them being sent over to save ole Gaddafi huh? Why not? Do the Math. It's all about that 'D' &amp; 'R' thing for these people.

Wow. If true,this is shocking in so many ways. How were the Taliban able to locate and kill this Team? It seems like it had to be an inside job. The Afghans had to be involved. I don't believe in coincidences.

365 Coalition Troops killed this year? Man,that's a lot. I didn't realize the casualties were that high this year. Our MSM doesn't seem very interested in covering the Afghan War much. I'm really not sure why.

They report it every day, but there's not much to report since reporters aren't allowed in many of these operations. We don't want Geraldo Rivera or some other reporter drawing attack plans in the sand again, do we?

"Bush started this war." Yeah, Bush was behind 9/11, right?

Oh, it was only Bush that wanted to get back at those behind 9/11.

Liberals weren't claiming Afghanistan was the "legit" war during the 2008 election?

You asshole just make things up week to week trying to look smart.

Or even better, when are they going to syria to protect the people there? No flotillas for the mass slaughter victims in Hama or Da'araa?

You want to laugh at what hypocritical, racist trash the far-left anti-war scumbags are, check out code pink's site, there is not a fucking word mentioning syria. Or even better, call the communist/marxist lowlifes at International Answer, the other fucking trash cindy sheehan-allied group that made a name for itself fighting Bush "and his wars." Ask them why they are not protesting the war crimes the syrian regime is committing in syria, and they'll manufacture every BS nonsense excuse in the book.

Yes it does seem that Seal Team 6 has been decimated in this attack. How did this happen? How did the Taliban know where to find these guys? This smells of an inside job for sure. Afghans had to be involved in revealing the location of this chopper.

A slight disagreement. The war in Afghanistan was completely necessary. If a mistake was made there, it was when the Bush administration diverted our military forces to Iraq in 2003 before the Afghan war as wrapped up. Now we are almost having to start over again there.

It is important that we do the job right so we don't have to go back in 5 or 10 years.
