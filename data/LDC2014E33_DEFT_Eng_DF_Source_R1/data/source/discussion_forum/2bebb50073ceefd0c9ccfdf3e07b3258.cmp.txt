What do other parents do regarding pocket-money?

I have two boys 8 &amp; 6, and did £1 a week a couple of years ago and they just played with it and lost it. Then the older one figured out how to persuade the young one to give him all the pocket money! So haven't bothered for a while. However we are just about to start 'Performance Related Pocket Money' the performance is the school spellings and maths test, I knew the kids had spells but they also have maths tests but the results weren't put in the home work book so never knew about it till I ask the question at a numeracy evening, that boys for you! Any how it's £1 for 100% correct, 50p for if you get one wrong and zero for 2 or more wrong. Has any other patents tried such 'Performance Related Pocket Money' and if so what was it and hoe did it go?

Interesting. Do adults have their pay halved for 1 mistake at work and then get no pay at all if they make 2 mistakes? That's you lost in the last sentence!
More seriously are they capable of 100%, not all children are. How does a 'near miss' count as opposed to gobbledegook? What if they do try very hard at their homework and blow it at the test. Are you going for effort or result?
Needs thinking about.

We dont do that for pocket money but when the kids are good they get a tick on their chart. Each tick gives them 15 mins on the xbox or wii at a weekend or we go and see a film if they have enough. Works well for us. Ds1 gets an extra tick when he gets all his spellings right. Since we have started doing it he has come home with a certificate from school each week saying he has got all his spellings right. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/biggrin.gif"/>
