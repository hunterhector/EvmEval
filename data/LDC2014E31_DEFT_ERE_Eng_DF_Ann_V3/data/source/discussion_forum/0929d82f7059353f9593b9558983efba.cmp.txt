I sure as hell know ZIMMERMAN has no civil rights complaint. Kid gloves for a guy who just shot someone else to death. Even police have to take time off work, not Zimmerman, he's suddenly the VICTIM.

Who said Zimmerman is a victim? Other than you, of course.

It's the biggest, hottest news story in media.

Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?

Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest, most powerful media organization on the world?

Just watched Shepard Smith. He had on an older heavy set white guy who apparently was the author of the law. The guy who wrote it said this law does not apply.
Then Shepard went on about a young teen who bought Skittles from a 7-11 and while unarmed, was walking back to his father while he was followed by an armed man who police told to stop following the kid. The young teen is now dead and the killer is still walking around armed.

I know. It was really weird to see such a thing on Fox. Maybe because it's coming from their token gay.

Or.... maybe it's because those are the established facts of this gutwrenchingly sad situation?

Twit.

I'm watching him now. I was watching the Al Sharpton show previously, but I'm now back on my FOXWATCH.

For the record, it is a Saudi, not 'the Saudis'.

Thank you for the link. But that info is from 2007, best I can tell. He may own more now. Or less. But I doubt that he would sell any. It's not like he needs the money.

Wiki is easy enough to update - should the share percentage have changed, I'm sure it would have been included.

The fact remains, you got shown to be a petty moronic whiner who clearly does not bother to fact check information. I do. Which is why I know that it is one Saudi, not 'the saudis'... and it is a mere 7% - hardly a controlling interest.

So, how come you're not accusing sallow of 'pulling' information 'out of his ass'? Because he's a liberal. Unlike myself. I'm a conservative, therefore you challenge my information. You are a dishonest and mindless hack... and a mindnumbingly boring poster.

Two things here:

1 - I thought that in the past, you laughed at WIKI being used as a source.
2 - I thought that in the past, you have claimed not to be a conservative, but an independent.

Discussing his injuries, how the killing "went down" indicates the killer is now the VICTIM.

Everything's fair game on a public board.

If she wanted it to be truly "her business" she would have not been a member of this particular website.

Too much of the the "fair game" trash got a young man killed.

</quote>

This one I have to disagree with you adamantly on.

What got that young man killed was racist views and a demented man with a chip on his shoulder.

That is an opinion, it is not established as fact.

The NRA heavily pushed the Stand Your Ground bill which Jeb signed. I think Fox wants to stay on good terms w/ the NRA
