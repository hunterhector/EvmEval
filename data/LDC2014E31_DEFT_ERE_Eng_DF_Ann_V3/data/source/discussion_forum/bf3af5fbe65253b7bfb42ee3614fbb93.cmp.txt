Al Qaeda Denies Assassination of Bhutto:

AL-QAEDA linked Pakistani militant Baitullah Mehsud was not involved in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, his spokesman said.

"He had no involvement in this attack," Mehsud's spokesman Maulvi Omar said by telephone from an undisclosed location.

"This is a conspiracy of the Government, army and intelligence agencies," he said.

"I strongly deny it. Tribal people have their own customs. We don't strike women."

Just <a href="http://afghanwomennews.blogspot.com/2007/09/violence-in-afghanistan-surges-taliban.html">one example</a> among many:

Amid the violence, Afghan women and girls are particularly targeted. In the past two weeks, two women reporters -- one of whom was a headmaster at a girls' school -- were murdered. Last week, two gunmen opened fire outside a girls' school, killing two girls and wounding six others.

That's actually my point. I don't think we should put too much stock in confessions or denials.

I laugh so hard every time he mentions Occam's Razor. The poor sap has no understanding of that principle means. He thinks that if you just mention it with each claim it will somehow make him feel smart. It's a tell tale sign of someone who doesn't understand what they are talking about.

Isn't that kind of inconvenient for your theory that OBL is a CIA/Zionist tool, MaGZ?

</quote>
I have never claimed OBL was ever CIA or a Zionist. OBL is an enemy of Western Civilization, America and the Jews.

I am a little hazy on the blast aspects of the incident. Did the bomb go off in the car? I was under the assumption that the shooter was also the suicide bomber. Was be close enough to cause significant "blast" injury to her? Anyone have access to more details of the autopsy (I assume there was a thorough one). So far I have garnished only the head injury element of the alleged "cause".

This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq-DwHXx4oI">BBC video</a> shows that the shooter and bomber were two different people.

It also indicates that she was hit by the gunfire.

heres a slow motion version, seven seconds of that video, she had clearly dropped inside the vehicle way before the blast. My belief is the shots found their mark.

Bhutto told Frost that Osama Bin Laden is dead. Did THAT get her killed?

An Inside Job? The Assassination of Benazir Bhutto

by Peter LaVenia / December 28th, 2007

The assassination of Benazir Bhutto is the latest act in the tragicomedy that envelops Pakistani politics. As will no doubt be repeated endlessly the next few days, her father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was murdered at the orders of Zia ul-Haq, military dictator of Pakistan during the late 1970s and early 1980s. As will no doubt turn out to be the case, Ms. Bhutto has also been assassinated by the Pakistani government  though most of the international media reports will focus on militant tribal, Taliban, or Al Qaeda elements from the countrys northwestern frontier, as if said groups acted without the knowledge or encouragement of influential parts of the Pakistani government.

Wow, I can't believe you linked to NesNYCs favorite website as though we would actually give serious consideration to it.

The people who run that site are the only ones I've seen who could give Rick Rajter's jew hatred a run for his money.
