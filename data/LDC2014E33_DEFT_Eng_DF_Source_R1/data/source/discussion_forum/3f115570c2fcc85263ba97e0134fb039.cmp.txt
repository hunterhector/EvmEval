This is actually quite amazing. Being a conservationist I have no problem with green energy projects. I believe in multiple sources of energy.

On the other hand I do have a problem with taxpayer dollars funding failures on the whims of nutjobs in Washington.

Earlier this week, Stimulus beneficiary Evergreen Energy bit the dust.

Then, Ener1, a manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles and recipient of Stimulus largesse, filed for bankruptcy.

And today, the Las Vegas Sun reports that Amonix, Inc., a manufacturer of solar panels that received $5.9 million from the Porkulus, will cut two-thirds of its workforce, about 200 employees, only seven months after opening a factory in Nevada.

This is just this week alone.

They still pale to comparison to the $500,000,000 wasted on Solyndra. Someone needs to go to jail for that one.

Damn straight.

What really bothers me about this is that if you study Euro models of green energy, they are actually effective and do able (how do you spell that). The issue is cost effectiveness. I was watching one business program with an awesome finance critic Amanda Lang and she had gone to Germany to interview people who had succeeded in affordable green.

But all I see over here is the government throwing cash at an issue demanding no results.
Consequently getting none either.

Just that deep flushing sound.
