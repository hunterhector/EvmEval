I'm interested to know what you would consider to be a happy ending to your situation? I suppose a happy ending would be where him and his wife mutually decide that their relationship is not worth salvaging

Your original post/question suggested to me that you are not happy with your relationship and now I have read the entire thread, your subsequent posts have confirmed my initial thoughts. No, I am not happy with things as they currently stand

I would not be surprised if his wife had uttered the same words and possibly another mistress.

Unfortunately, the damage has been done and you and your lover have hurt people - they just don't know it yet, but they will find out eventually. They will then have to live with the devastation and you and your lover will have to live with the fact that you both caused the damage. Whether this was intentional or not, you are now aware of what you are both doing. I am aware of it

I think you need to pay more consideration to what you believe to be the state of his marriage - everything you know is what he has told you, only one side of the story. He may be telling you what he believes you want to hear or what he believes he should say in order to sustain the relationship you currently share. I personally do not believe you are propping up the relationship in anyway but I am very interested to know why you feel this may be the case? IMHO, you would be the perfect excuse for him to leave his relationship. If you were not available, what excuse would he have to leave? Unless of course there was someone else? His relationship may have indeed not been perfect before you arrived... but was there maybe someone else to distract him? Regardless of what people may say on here, and how much they may think I am being just used as a fool, I do not think this. I don't believe he is a serial philanderer, or that he is taking what he is doing lightly. Yes, I would be the perfect excuse to leave, but I know he does not want to disrupt his childrens lives at this point in time.

Again, unfortunately, none of that will matter to the people you are both hurting.

I don't want to upset you and I am sorry but do feel you should consider why he does not think you are worth leaving his wife for if his marriage is as he states.

You have a big decision to make and I believe you already know the answer but just need convincing/encouragement that it is the right thing to do possibly. Do you have any friends you can discuss this with? I do hope you make the right decision for all involved. As someone mentioned previously, treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.

Aside from the above, I am intrigued to know why after so long your daughter does not know about your relationship. Please do not share your reasons if you do not feel comfortable - you owe no explanation to me. It's just that I have drawn my own conclusions and I am curious to know if I am right or wrong <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> My daughter does not need to know about this relationship as he is not part of her life, he is part of mine and she has no reason to meet him. If we ever were to get together as a 'proper' couple, then I would feel it appropriate to introduce them

I wish you courage <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>

havent read many of the posts here but basic story is my wife's ex had an affair (his other women was also cheating on her husband) and he ended up leaving her and his children for the other women, who also left her husband for him, they actually stayed together for 10 years however they have now split up because she has had another affair.

so can they have a happy ending? who knows i believe they probably could as i do not believe my wifes ex husband could have another affair based on how he was after he had left her and children (guilt etc even after 4 years when i first met him) however his 'other women' of course is a case of not changing her spots

personally i wouldnt want to be the bit on the side

You say your son has met him, so basically what you are saying to him is that he can get married and cheat on his wife if the "going gets tough". Wow, what a great mum you are!

This is my thread in a similar vein but seeing it from the other side, as a woman whose husband has had an affair.

If that's your idea of happiness, you're seriously away with the fairies.
