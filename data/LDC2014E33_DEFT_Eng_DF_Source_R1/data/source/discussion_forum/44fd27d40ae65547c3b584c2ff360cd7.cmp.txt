This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

Hate to point out the obvious (I lie) but when Murdoch inherited those tow papers in Australia he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country. He then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth. If that is not a self made man I have never heard of one.

Well them you, squire, have never heard of one.

He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire and made himself on of the wealthiest men in the world. Explain to me, in detail, and using the small words you can understand, how that is not an example of a self made man.

The ows are just a bunch of spoiled kids that want great pay w/o the education or effort it takes to get it.

None of them are taking personal responsibility, just blaming Wall St.

I'd be embarrassed to have anyone in my family involved in this non-sense.

Obviously you're totally ignorant as to the make up of the people participating in the protests. They are senior citizens who got screwed out of their retirement...they are college grads who GOT the grades and are now looking at debt w ith NO job prospects....they are parents, spouses, long time employees who saw their jobs outsourced overseas....and ALL of them have watched Wall St. and it's banking buddies in management making out like bandits, and then bitch that they may have to give up some tax breaks and loopholes.

If I were YOU, I'd be embarassed to voice your ignorance in public.

Utter fucking nonsense.

I just went from one job to another. It took me a whole month to find it.

There's jobs, it's just that those whiny bitches won't take anything they can find.

Your lack of information and vast wealth of propaganda, must make it hard to carry on an honest conversation.

Sure they are. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Stop getting your info from Fox.

You guys talk about class warfare, I think the right is more involved in class warfare than anyone else. The problem is, you are going after people just like you.

Dont be dim.

I listen to what they say on camera, on msnbc, abc and fox.

They are all a bunch of spoiled kids, or whiny adults that want other people to take care of them.
