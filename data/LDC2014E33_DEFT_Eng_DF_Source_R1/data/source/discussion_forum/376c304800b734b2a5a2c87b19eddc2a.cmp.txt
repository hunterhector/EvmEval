I don't know who you refer to, Walter.
But, if you are alluding to the idea that some people may die, I agree. I have been feeling like the death of the Roadmap would be a catalyst to increased violence, and perhaps all out war.

I think the expulsion of Arafat may bring that on.

I've had the idea that the Roadmap was a turning point toward one of the two possible directions-- toward peace, or the beginning of the ultimate fighting between the two.

Reminiscent of that literate comedian, Jerry Clower. When the hunter and the cougar were stuck up in the tree, fighting and scratching--the hunter called down to his partner, "Shoot! Shoot!"

His partner said, "I can't shoot up there. I might hit you." And the hunter said, "Shoot up here amongst us. One of us got to have some relief!"

I believe the Pals and Israelis are fast getting to that point. My heart goes out to all of them. (The innocents, who have to live in that violence, anyway...)

Unfortunately they're going to end up at the same address six feet under - they be Pals or Israelis.

For some reason the top line of options is gone from my puter, so I can't bring links, cut or paste...

But, I just read on MSNBC that the Israeli cabinet has decided to expel Arafat--in the time and manner of their choosing--

8 in favor, against 2. They also say they are considering occupying Gaza, where Hamas resides.

The Palestinians are in the streets...

I do not think they will expel Arafat in the next month.

Sofia, try rightclicking the area where the buttons were and seeing if "Address bar' or "standard buttons" is unchecked.

What makes you think they'll wait?

(Thanks. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/> I had tried that, and it just says restore, close, minimize. Its 3AM here. My son can fix it (hopefully) tomorrow. I tried my settings, too. That's about the limit of my understanding of this crazy, glowing box.)

A-HA! I did it! I went in through my control panel, and back to A2K, only now my screen looks like I'm looking out through a funky blue dashboard. (I screwed around with my settings.)

But, all good.

I think that they realize that there is probably not a nation on earth that thinks it is a good idea.

Not that it matters to themso much as the fact that the Us government does not think it's a good idea.

If it happens I think it will be when the US public supports the idea to a degree that the administration would not be able to put much pressure on Israel.

I'd like to expound on my prediction. With US diplomats on the way to pressure Israel there is some mumbling about building a prison around Arafat instead of exiling him.

What many fail to realize is that exiling Arafat might not be an option. He might be killed and that would be even harder on Israeli PR.

The US is still against the move and IMO the only way we will see Arafat exiled is immediately after a terrorist attack. If there is an attack with more than 10 casualties I believe Israel might make the attempt within the 48 hour window of the aftermath.

Waiting for an attack sounds like Israel's MO.

They have stated they aren't following the US advice on this. You think they're bluffing about that?

I second. Every attack by the Palestinians is a victory for Sharona nd Co., becasue it gives them justification for another counter. Both sides are wrong. Neither wants peace, both want victory. Even if it means most of their own side dies in the process.
