As you know, recently my mother died, and she named me and my sister as the executors of her will. My sister has abdicated from that responsibility as she has work and family commitments, meaning it is solely up to me.

My mother had no assets of note (ie. not much) but a LOT of debts, so I don't think there will be a probate.

I have two accounts at my bank, my main one and a secondary one which I haven't used for a long time, and me and my father went to the bank today to arrange for that account to be used for holding money for making the repayments, yet I signed something from the Bereavement Centre and that they will inform me of next steps in about a week.

The later step is to close her old accounts, but this cannot be done until the bank gets a copy of the proper death certificate, not just the one from the Coroner we provided - unfortunately, that won't be until the inquest is completed in late September.

I think it's a case of giving my dad the account number so he can start transferring money to it, then telling the credit card companies the account details so they can take it out - I really don't know how it works.

The point is, my dad will write all the letters and I will sign them, is that OK?

I've never done this before and I'm not sure just what a responsibility it will be, and I'm a bit nervous about the whole thing.

Any advice would be more than welcome.

Sorry to hear of your loss.

As for being an executor, yes, it does appear to be very intimidating; an almost impossible task. In reality, it is a fairly straightforward procedure.

Firstly, I'm not legally trained, so anyone who wants to tell me I'm wrong, etc etc...
However, my Dad died a couple of years ago, and I was the executor, so I've been through the process, and can share my experience.

I decided to deal with things myself after seeing the solicitor where my Dad made his will, who explained that we (me &amp; my sister) could abdicate our responsibility (she was also named as executor) and the solicitor would deal with it, and it would cost between 3 - 5k. At this point my sister gave up her role, so I became the sole executor, as I'm too much of a skinflint to part with that kind of money. Besides, my Dad had put me as executor, so I did feel it was kind of my duty, and I did feel like I should, if that makes sense.

Firstly, there's no need to panic or rush. You are expected to have other commitments, so don't think you have to get everything dealt with in a matter of days.

As regards Probate, all that is, is the legal entitlement to deal with a persons estate, and if there's a will, and you're the executor, it should be simple.

Is there any property involved?

With regards to the regular bills etc, the best tip I could give you is get some form of box/file, to keep everything together, and write everything down. You're on here, so I'm assuming you have a PC &amp; are computer literate, so if you have a word processor &amp; a spreadsheet, use those.
Gather as many bills etc as you can, and make sure you get any that come through now too. Think of anything that may have been in your Mum's name (gas, electric, catalogues, credit card, banks etc).
Write yourself a standard/template letter informing companies/organisations of the death, and send them out.

Then it's a case of gathering any asset information, bank accounts etc, and and adding everything up, and then doing the same with the bills, and doing a balance.
If, after you've gathered all the information &amp; done the sums, and there isn't enough in the assets amount to cover the debts amount, you'll have to write to people again, and say just that, that unfortunately there are not enough assets to meet the liabilities.

At this point you'll have to do a bit more research though, because I don't know how things stand with your dad, and if there are joint liabilities &amp; assets in both their names.

This next bit might sound a bit mean, but keep a note &amp; receipts of anything you buy, stamps, envelopes, phone calls etc, as the cost of these will need to be met by the estate. You can make a decision later to ignore the amount if you wish, but at least be aware of it.

And as regards signing the letters your dad gives you, make sure you understand them, and are happy with their content, as it is you that is sending them out, and you the other companies will be dealing with.

Don't be intimidated, don't be rushed, look online for advice, and even get on the phone to some of the organisations, there is a lot of help available.

Once again, my condolences.

[edit]

And one more point, after the inquest, when you can get the official death certificate, get several certified copies, as many will want to see an original (not photocopy), and some wanted to keep a copy. It's far easier (and cheaper) to get them all at the earliest opportunity. When my Dad died, I got five copies, and could have done with a couple more.
