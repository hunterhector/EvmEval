Shirley Sherrod, we now know that her video was edited, yet it was played on Fox again and again. And when poor Shirley was forced to resign, Fox comes out with a report, just tonight, that Obama threw an "innocent" woman under the bus. Now, Fox says she's innocent. Only now.
What video? What report?

Then there's James OKeefe and Acorn. A single Republican, able to bring down an organization that helped the poor, from spliced together video tapes. Well, he is getting sued. But, "he did it". Now all those poor people are a little more poor.
WTF are you talking about?

Then there were Republican leaders privately telling Obama that they would work with him and then publicly, saying they would do everything they could to bring him down (they called it "Waterloo"). And they did. And poor Obama believed them time and time again. I wonder if he believes them now?
"They" who? Which Republican leaders?

There was Iraq. That was because of WMDs, no, because of yellow-cake, no, it was to bring "freedom", no, it was.....
How many years back are we going to go here?

There was the 2.4 trillion dollar tax cut. Supposed to bring jobs. And it did. It brought them to China and India and even Mexico.
Still looking backwards?

Then there was April 16th 2008, Healthcare Decisions Day, proclaimed by the former Gov. of Alaska, Sarah Palin. In fact, it was such a good idea, that Democrats used the SAME legislation in the Health Care Bill. Only Sarah stopped calling it, "Healthcare Decisions Day", no, instead she called it "death panels" and "kill grandma". Another fast one.
Never heard of it..... Link?

And this unemployment bill? Stripped of everything that would help the economy. Now Republicans say, "Where's the roads being built? Where's the dam's being restored? Where's the bridges being fixed?" Well, they should know. They forced Democrats into removing them from any legislation.
Roads, dams, and bridges were supposed to be paid for with the failed Stimulus package, not the 'unemployment bill'.

Imagine if Republicans put all the sneakiness into helping the middle class. Into actually rebuilding the country. Into being on the side of regular Americans. Yea, imagine that.

God you guys are dumb. Don't you even watch the news?????????

Do any of you guys know how to use a "search engine". Every fucking thing has to be "spoon fed". And still you believe lies over truth.

Try, "Sarah Palin Health Care Decisions Day" and there's about a million hits in 3.5 seconds.

And you don't know about Acorn and James O'Keefe? Seriously?

And what's happening today is because of what happened, uh, "backward".

Goofs.

Contrary to the persistent vomiting of 24hr news networks, the news doesn't really change as often as their advertisers would have you believe.

You opened with vague remarks, assuming the world knows WTF you're talking about, and respond by calling people goofs for not being as lacking in a real life so as not to be stuck watching bullshit 24/7 like you.

Vague? What was vague? About Shirley Sherrod? About James OKeefe and Acorn? About Health Care Decisions day? About the unemployment bill? What was "vague"?

Those are truths Republicans can't bear to face.
