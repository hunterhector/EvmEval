I won't go into the whole story here, but I've been best friends with this guy for about 5 years now, and for the last 2 years we've had something between us. Out of the blue the other week he suddenly told me he can't see us being more than friends, and never will. (after me staying over his lots for the past year, sleeping together all the time, texting/calling non-stop, him tell me I was the most important person in his life)
I was absolutely devastated. Throughout the time we were kind of together he slept with his ex a fair few times, including once about a month ago.
I went to see another male friend last night who I know has a thing for me, and he started hitting on me and I let him have sex with me, until I realised I couldn't do it and stopped and made him take me home. I couldn't not tell the guy I loved. I told him, and he's angry and me, but he told me he didn't want me before I did it. I feel **** about having sex with this other guy, but how can he care when he essentially dumped me?
I felt so terrible that I went insane on my thighs and cut them to bits because I can't bear for anyone else to see them ever again. I just feel like my life is kind of over.

Girl! Your obv young and it's part of youth, Broken hearts that is!

Tick it off your checklist and move on, there's more to life than feeling sh-- about yourself. You and ur ex obv still care for each other and wants to stay friends.

Do not blame yourself by self harming. I know you are heartbroken but it's completely normal.

Swallow your pride and apologise and tell them the situation got the better of you. You wer on the moving on stage which hurts the most BUT seriously tho, blaming yourself is def not worth it.

Hugs, stay strong BIT--! I know you will choose the best decisions in the future with the new strong you <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Ps: I'm gay, I'm amazing I know <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

C'mon. Grow a pair of ovaries. There's more to life than a couple of men.

They will heal eventually, but its done now, the guy doesn't like you, it hurts I know, but you have to just get over it, find other people and friends to hang round with, I know you have lost your best friend and the person you loved, but there are many othe rpeople out there waiting for you to get to know them, look to the future and try not to let it get you down, cry if you need to, but dont harm anymore, it hurts the people that care about you more than you know..
I hope it works out in the end...
