Every single person who is assuming Zimmerman should be in jail just because the kid he shot was black.

Come to think of it, that would include you, which might explain why you don't see it. The police report indicated that Zimmerman had a cut on his head, the girlfriend said she heard some type of struggle over the phone before the shots, and there is even a witness that claims he saw that fight. All of that proves that Zimmerman told the police the truth.

What the police have to find out now is if Zimmerman instigated the confrontation. If he did, he should face charges. If he was just following him to make sure he didn't break into a house somewhere in the neighborhood, and Martin actually initiated, and escalated, the confrontation, he shouldn't. Until I know the facts I won't make a decision.

The "fight" was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS....IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE.

WTF are YOU babbling about?

Why do you hate America so much?

Are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon/teabagger BS? Or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon/teabagger cousin's stupidity?

In America we have a thing called Due Process. We do not approve of Lynch-Mobs. I know that bothers you Socialists/Progressives, but that's the way it is. So get over it.

Hey genius, "due process" includes PROPER POLICE PROCEDURE....that means you DO NOT just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning, drug/alcohol test. The call for justice is a call for Zimmerman to be arrested, not "lynched".

Intellectually dishonest libertarians/neocons/teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life....but the FACTS will always be your undoing. Carry on.

Candy Crowley on CNN, their chief political correspondent, this AM asked Gov Scott of Florida why it "took more than a month to react?"

Today is Sunday the 25th of March and the shooting took place on Sunday February 26th. That's 28 days ago which is now exactly a month ago, and the Gov appointed a special prosecutor and a task force to investigate on the 22nd. So why wasn't she able to report this factually, and based on that why should we believe her reporting?

Those idiots can only think of one answer to the question because anything else would spoinl their attempt to make this a race issue.

The reason that it took so long is that the Sanford Police investigated the incident and determined that Zimmerman's story checked out and they released him. That should have been it but the parents of the boy weren't satisfied and then ONLY because Treyvon is black and they thought Zimmerman was white, did it become a major story. Now that it is, Gov.Scott is placating the hysterical lynch mob by having someone look into it. the fact that after all that, Zimmerman is still a free man today makes me suspect that Zimmerman's story still checks out. Mind you, it is only speculation on my part.

Please stop treating your supposition and conjecture as fact.

It took the PARENT of Martin 3 days before they got the word from the local police dept. as to what happened to their missing kid. Zimmerman was NEVER taken down to a precinct for an OFFICIAL questioning DESPITE being involved in a fatal shooting. He still hasn't to this day.

No decent foresnics.

WTF is that all about?

If it were NOT for the due diligence of local black media (and then national black media) along with Progressive radio stations, the Main Stream Media would have kept this story on the back burner....hell, Fox News was STILL the last one to catch on with coverage AFTER the Big 3 started coverage.

Gov. Scott is involved because of the PRESSURE brought by the various groups and the (now) national media examination.

Try dealing with the FACTS instead of your wishful thinking.

Zimmerman was taken into custody, and released after the police determined they had no probable cause.

As for the forensics, do you think the world works like CSI? Most of the crap they show is impossible half the rest is junk science, and half of the real stuff they show won't hold up in court. Most police departments can't do a fraction of the forensics that actually exists, so the police screwing it up is not part of some massive conspiracy.

Why don't you start dealing with the facts before you try lecturing others.
