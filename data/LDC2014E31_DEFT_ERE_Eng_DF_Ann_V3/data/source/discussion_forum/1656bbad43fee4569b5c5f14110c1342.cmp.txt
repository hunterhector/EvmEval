Has anyone noticed what a mess the salt and freezing conditions are making to the roads.

Every road I have travelled on recently has developed numerous and significant pot holes, even major dual carriageways - haven't been on any motorways recently.

On the way into work this morning I found myselve weaving around them on a dual carriageway that I normally do 70mph on.

Seems to me it's going to get quite dangerous when everyone starts travelling at normal speeds once more.

On top of that the cost and disruption to fix them is going to be huge.

Or am I just unlucky with the roads I use.

Cheers,

Nigel

It's a nationwide problem which has had national coverage in the press lately.
The AA did a survey of road engineers for local councils prior to the winter.
It revealed that there were 980000 potholes on UK roads.
Their latest estimate is that the snow will increase that figure to 1.5 million.
Councils current choices are not to fix them, or to go into debt to fix them.

Last weekend, I hit a massive hole on the M8 through Glasgow.
Still awaiting estimate from the garage, but looks like significant enough to warrant an insurance claim.
This was the M8, not some back road.
If motorways have massive potholes, what hope is there for lesser roads?

Edit, there was also an interview with a road engineer on R2 the other night.
He said the problem is the UK does not have a plan for renewing road surfaces.
The expected life span of tarmac is 25 years being resurfacing.
We are currently expecting roads to go for 60-80 years without resurfacing. <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

To my dismay, I am having to change my car to suit the roads.
I have had several pothole incidents with my 19" shod BMW.
I have now 'given in' and accepted I cannot drive a car with wheels like this on UK roads.
I am now, for the first time ever, considering a 4x4, just so the car is tough enough to cope!
Ironic that the very cars the government are trying to force us out of, are the best to cope with the roads..... <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/facepalm.gif"/>

the alpina has a very deep dish on the rear asking to be buckled at the slightest pothole or moderate kerb.... bmw in particular rims are not the best for uk roads, even including the mv's....

some good advice i received from an alloy wheel repairer recently is to ensure the tyre pressure was near the upper limits if using very low profiles.... has worked for me so far...i pump the rears (265/30/19) to about 38-40psi and the fronts to the same.... <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

although my alloys are forged, i have not had the same problem as my cousin in his audi cabriolet.... 2 buckles on the same road we both drive regularly... <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>
