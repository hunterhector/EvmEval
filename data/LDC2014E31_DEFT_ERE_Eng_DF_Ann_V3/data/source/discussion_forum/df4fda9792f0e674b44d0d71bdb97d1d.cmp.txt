This thread is devolving into the usual "Rape the Rich" bullshit from the mindless left. That's too bad, because Mustang touched upon an interesting subject in the OP.

We do have a disparity of "justice" in this nation, a severe one. The well connected are virtually immune to our laws, Marc Rich was as bad or worse that Bernie Madoff, but a quick bribe to Bill Clinton ensured that he was immune from prosecution for his crimes.

<a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,99302,00.html">The Marc Rich Case: A Primer - TIME</a>

Ted Kennedy murdered a girl who was pregnant, assumable with his child, but then, paternity tests were never run, due to his "status" he was never prosecuted.

Bill Clinton openly threatened Betty Currie that if she did not perjure herself he would fire her and ensure she lost her pension. But since he is a powerful democrat, he got away with it.

Time and again we see that there is one set of laws for the well connected, and a vastly different set for the commoners. And it isn't just being able to afford high end attorneys. Clinton was never Criminally CHARGED with witness tampering and racketeering, though absolutely proven guilty, it's on tape. Kennedy was never CHARGED with murder, though it's irrefutable that he did murder Mary Jo.

Back room deals are cut to keep the well connected from even facing a court room. No need for lawyers because the strings are pulled so that they aren't ever charged in the first place. This nation was founded on the principle of law, yet we see that this isn't what we have. Partisans cheer the subversion of the law because "their team" got away with it, and they care only about their party, not justice. The justice system is a farce and we all know it. Corruption is the rule, not the exception. Even at the municipal level the very concept of justice is perverted. We have traffic laws that exist for no reason other than to fine motorists. If a man with a gun targets a person purely for revenue, what can we call this other than armed robbery? All the way up the chain this goes, judges handing out long sentences to ensure that the prison guard union has plenty of work, in return for donations to keep the judge in office.

In California a woman got a ticket for talking on her cell phone. The law said it was a $20 fine.

So she was fined $20, then assessed a $250 processing fee, then an $80 court fee. So was this upholding the law, or just armed robbery?

Our justice system is rotten to the core, so what are we going to do about it? Play "Rape the Rich" games because that's what Obama wants? Should we be occupied with envy and greed like the Shitters, demanding more for Unions and Illegals, or should we really look at the shambles our injustice system is in?

Regarding the comment: "Rape the Rich" from the mindless left.

Let me see if I understand your point of view. Wealth and power are in fact concentrated to a decreasing number of people; and you take objection to their abuse of power to manipulate the justice system. HOWEVER, you find it inanely absurd (to the point that it is mindless) to think that the same wealth/power is not used to manipulate the law making process, tax code, or financial institutions. Is that accurate?

Not really.

The the population in the top 1%, 5% and 10% of income earners has stayed pretty static relative to total population since 1990.

Yes, I oppose corruption. I have no issue with wealth. The more wealth created, the better. I support wealth and oppose corruption.

I'm the opposite of the democrats, I suppose, who oppose wealth and favor corruption.

Again, the issue is one of corruption. Equal justice under the law is the foundation of this nation. We have lost that, we have distinctly different laws for the well connected than we do for the common people.

Wealth and power often go hand in hand, in the case of the Clintons, the wealth is a by-product of political power. It is the connections that pervert the law though, not the wealth.

Simply put, I believe that Barack Obama should be held to the same law that Tyrone Jackson in San Bernardino is - and I don't think you can argue that he is.
