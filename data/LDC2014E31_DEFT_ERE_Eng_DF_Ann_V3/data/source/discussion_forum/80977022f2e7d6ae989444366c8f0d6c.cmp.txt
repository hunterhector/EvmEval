It went wrong the day he was born.

Not for the one million Texans who got the jobs Perry helped recruit.

As a Texan, I'm glad we're getting him back.

As an American, I regret the nation will not be using his great talents at putting people back to work.

Rick Perry is a great American man. He makes our state a pretty good place to work, but the voters in key states decided against his ability to provide jobs on account of listening to news sources with petty critiques against him.

It is dead. Thank God. The pendulum had swung way too far into the Twilight Zone.

I don't think so. The thing is, the TEA Movement hasn't really been around long enough to establish solid leaders. It took 16 years between Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan for the modern conservative movement to take hold.

Horrible analogy. You forget Goldwater actually won the nomination.

After Romney loses, Perry might well be able to take another shot at it. But he should take his time and spend more time introducing himself to the American public.

Perry's problem is that he sounds too much like Bush.

You know what. I won't call anyone of these candidates a joke or a flake. They've all had very respectable careers.

And I'm sorry. Running as a Republican candidate means you get the shit kicked out of you, your family, your friends and your kindergarten teacher and your dog by the left wing media arm of the White House on a day to day basis.

It takes balls to run. Kudos to Perry for trying.

So much for the conservative mantra of personal responsibility.

Rightists are the biggest whiners  blame everyone but oneself.

Perrys failure was his own alone, having nothing to do with the mythical liberal media.

From the onset. It was clear he wasn't serious about being president. Serious meaning that he didn't take the time to prepare for the race.

</quote>

He was a little busy recovering from back surgery, geaux, and he went into the race too soon after surgery. He simply wasn't himself. Coaches make their athletes take off a year sometimes, depending on the surgery and the amount of time they can take a 16-year-old high school player to a 35-year-old professional ballhandler back on the field. Campaigns are rigorous, and Perry is I think at least 50. I'm sure he had the best of care, but I think I've heard some surgery anesthetics become residual and might slow people down mentally and physically. He had to have the surgery, and it was at the worst time. He's usually not one to get mixed up mid-sentence and has always been a good speaker.

Even so, it will be good to have our governor Rick Perry back. The Perrys are real nice people. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

point was, Goldwater lost the election. And the immediate response was to renominate Nixon the next cycle.

I hear people say that the TEA Movement goes too far and such. I still have yet to see anyone really tell me where they've gone too far.

He stumbled badly in the first debate and never recovered. It takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservatives. They are smart and they research issues, they want substantive answers. Perry couldn't answer the questions in depth and it showed.

If Perry was a Democrat, he'd be their candidate - liberals will buy anything....Hope and Change anyone?

Pretty much, yea.

Obviously someone lied to him.

</quote>

I'd call those both accurate statements.

Mittens is a frontrunner who only has about 30% support in a four man race. That's just kind of sad when you think about it.

And sorry. Most of the other candidates were a joke. When you had people looking at Cardboard Pizza Man seriously, there was a problem with the quality of candidates.

</quote>

Having the support of a third of the electorate in a four person race is pretty darn good.

If having 30% of the electorate is kind of sad, what does that say about your candidate who doesnt have close to that much?

</quote>

He doesn't have 30% of the electorate. He's got 30% of the maybe 20 million people who participate in GOP primaries. Which is only about 10% of the electorate.

Right now, I'm still behind Newt, but I'd be happy with Santorum. But the fact he's struggling with these guys after spending tens of millions of dollars and the MSM mercilessly attacking them says he's a weak candidate.

It went wrong because he's not smart enough to be President.

Serves you right for supporting an average candidate.
