Dude doesn't have a strong self defense case, sounds like a bad shoot if he instigated it. As long as he keeps repeating "I feared for my life, I feared for my life" he should be good though. He could simply say "he tried to enter my vehicle" and at that point he's golden. And if that is what happened then good shoot.

i really hate how you say "good shoot"/"bad shoot" like you are some kind of expert associated with law enforcement with tons of experience in evaluating these cases.

I would not. It's only racists like you that are trying to make this a race thing. There was a black chic that shot a white dude from her car after he approached her car in Jeffersonville IN. Initially I sided with her use of self defense. Later when it was learned she and her son got out of the car and started ghetto stomping the now shot white guy on the ground complete with video and racial taunts of "die white boy" did I say bad shoot.

She and son were charged and convicted as there was never any danger to her or her son.

You are neglecting the very many real possibilities of how and why this COULD be a good shoot.

Name the possibilties to me since the guy ignored all advise given to him by the police dispatcher. I can think of only one. That would be if the guy came to his car and threatened him. But then he would've shot from inside his car and not from outside of it.

You are ignoring the fact that the shooter in FL. like the one in Jeffersonville IN. could easily have avoided the confrontation by just driving away. He was in a car and chose to follow the victim. What was Treyvon going to do chase Mr. Zimmerman's car down and force him to pull out his gun?

</quote>
There is no duty to retreat in most states. Zimmerman was in a place he was legally allowed to be.

I agree that him following is what can make this a bad shoot (getting out of the car does not). We don't have all the facts.

I can just as easily say Treyvon could have very easily avoided getting shot if he didn't viciously attack Zimmerman.

As somebody who carries it is my duty to FULLY understand the laws in my state and know when I can and cannot fire. It just so happens that FL has very similar in laws.

I can see that. Your car is private property. But he shot on the sidewalk or street iirc.

Castle doctrine laws would protect him from any civil liability. By law the family is not able to sue if he acted in self defense.

</quote>
Hmm, I'm not sure about the specifics of civil law. If true, this may be a large miscarriage of justice. As said, I can easily see this guy not getting charged because, well, the opposing witness is dead. This doesn't mean the shooter was in the right, or that it was self-defense - it just doesn't prove it wasn't.

Quite frankly so was Treyvon Martin. but he's dead now. Fuck Mr. Zimmerman in my opinion.

Castle Doctrine, in many states, provides protection (as it should) when you are in any place you are legally allowed to be; such as the sidewalk.

And we don't know if Zimmerman instigated the attack (I would guess he did, probably told Martin he called the cops and told him not to move) he very well could have given his previous record.

1) he gets out of car, asks a few questions and then is attacked - perfect example of self defense
2) gets out of car, gets his ass kicked (but didn't start fight nor initial aggressor), goes back to his car to stop being attacked, attacker follows after orders to STOP - perfect example of self defense
3) black guy tries to enter vehicle or strike through vehicle - self defense

All of this hinges on who the initial aggressor was. If he started making it physical then it becomes much harder to make the case for self defense (unless in case#2 he was retreating back to his car for safety).
