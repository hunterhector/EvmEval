What I want to know is what do you really have against Jesse. I know him personally, I have marhed with him, and have worked for him. My favorite march with Jesse was the one from the chicken processing plant in N. Carolina where 120 women died in a fire because the owners locked the emergency exit so no one could sneak outside for a break. Wher the women even those pregnant were not allowed any breaks except a 30 minute lunch perid. We walked from the factory to the State Capitol in an effort to get the owners to provide some financial support to the children and families of the women who died. What is so wrong with that do to Jesse's efforts some benefits were paid by the company and the state relented and released some money too.

george, you just fully described me. As low a person as you think I am, I am really OK. I live, I breath, I love, I bleed red blood and I am one of those whose "worst qualities of an age and much of a generation notable mostly for its narcism and self-indulgence.
The irony of wistful recollections of past protest adventures clothed as they were in a style and form so like their own caricatures of the "reactionary" forces they opposed" and yet I fought on the ground in Viet Nam.

You know what - we were possibly over there at the same time, and I called and was a grateful receiver of many an air strick we called in. You may have been one of the bombers, I was one of those grunts on the other side of the "red smoke". Do you realize I was 1 1/2 clicks from a full blown B-52 strike. The B-52s were 6 miles away. You have no idea how scary it is for the bombs to be walking toward you and you only realized they were going to miss you as they went away. Yes, I was there and I was also one of "THEM" - before I went, while I was there and after I got back!

Herbert Spencer addresses this issue directly, "There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance--that principle is contempt prior to investigation."

But, for this I forgive you because God already has!

Joanne, the reason I have refused to argue about Jesse is because his detractors are too irrational about it. They all parrot identical words and phrases like they all memorized the same little pamphlet. As soon as you say anything in his defense they morph into "Jesse and Al sharpton". Any more and it's suddenly "Jesse and Al sharpton and farakhan". Endless name calling and nothing gets resolved.

Georgeob1....I sat on the curbstone with my friends as they shed their tears, the rough tough macho guys, as I'm sure we all did, and listened to them pour their hearts out, 'if they came home alive', the guys that were "lucky" to come back, and not in a body bag, ball less, legless, armless, footless. or in a wheelchair forever.
And for what? You tell me.

This country has lost sight of itself.

I stand by my assessment of Nixon and Cambodia. I stand by everything I have said on this thread. I consider that the Peace Movement and the Civil Rights Movement in conjunction embodied most of the more noble attributes of human striving, in that or any age.

george, I wanted to add one very important thing, I go a lot with gut feeling - it's my way. I feel you are a good man, I truly like you. One person's higher morals - another person sees as a fault. In the end we are all the same and we return to worm food!

I think the guys that fled to Canada were heros too. They gave up the comforts of home and being surrounded by friends and family let alone there status as wanted criminals.

Everyone made choices in that horrible war, we all wre affected. No one experience is more than any other.

It sent society into shambles - it was the destroyer of families, friendships and politics today are the result of the chasm. I have live my life on these issue, it is my pariah and and it is my saviour. Unfortunately, today it is coming back to haunt us. If GWB continues his course he will never be forgiven. Are there no lessons learned!
