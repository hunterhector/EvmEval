For the last few weeks students have been branded as thugs, layabouts, a waste and leeches on society.

Why on earth should we after graduating get jobs in the UK to pay tax to fund the pensions of these people who call us such names? Why should we help those who disrespect us so much?

Not only this but law students will be aiding these people in lawsuits and legal proceedings.

NHS Students will in the future be carrying out operations to help those very people who branded them worthless thugs.

Medicine students will be finding out about new treatments for diseases a lot of these older people are more likely to get.

Computer Scientists will be creating new technologies to make lives easier on a day to day basis from work to home experience - from programmes like AutoCad that keeps thousands in jobs.

Why the hell on this earth should we graduate and help these people branding us such things?

I am moving to a country where they respect students, where students get recognition for trying to improve themselves, gain more knowledge, try and gain a better education to help society in the long run. In this country students are massively disrespected yet at least they are trying to better themselves rather than running along to the JSA queue to claim from the taxpayer to do absolutely nothing.

Let me ask you people who brand us thugs.

Q: Who do you think will pay your pensions in the future when you are older?
A: The taxpayer - a lot of the high paying tax payers will be graduates

Q: Who will be contributing the most tax to help the country?
A: Ex graduates

Exactly, graduates will pay for you at one point so instead of labelling us as thugs and leeches you should encourage us to achieve the best in order to improve employment prospects which in turn will more than likely mean a bigger salary and a bigger contribution of tax.

I've had enough personally and after graduation and I don't even start until 2011 but once I graduate I will take my degree and I will go to countries like Germany, USA, Australia &amp; Eastern European countries where graduates/students are respected for their willingness to learn and the effort and time they put in. In the UK everyone just likes moaning.

Without students, this country would lose all its technically gifted people, would lose all its main surgeons and researchers and all its very well educated employees. Just you think about that! Its better to have too many people with a degree than not enough believe you me.

I just hope you people who brand us thugs never ever need a serious operation because I wonder if you will call that graduate a thug and worthless to society then when he is saving your life.

i agree with you, its a ironic story also. They hate the people that is going to be their future

A lot of the people that disagree with the students actions were students at some point. Do not think that you will be the only people to treat patients, defend/prosecute people in courts and the like. When the people you will work with and learn from when you actually earn a living will be graduates with more work experience than your lifespan, and a lot of them see the wrong doing in your actions.

Leaving the UK after graduation is a great idea, but be aware that this won't exempt you from paying back tuition fees and student loans.

The Student Loans company will still hunt you down and try to make you pay even if you live in Australia.

Yesterday was the day that the Lib Dems killed higher education in this country. 9k in fees today and then after a few years and inflation what next 20k a year ? 30k ? This won't be the last rise in tuition fees.

I'll pay back the loans for the education I received, I have no issues with that. I won't however be paying additional tax into the UK because students and graduates do not get any respect for trying to gain an education and improve their knowledge of a subject or sector.

That's fine.

I'll pay my loans back to the SLC and pay my tax to the Australian Government or the German government - governments that actually encourage students instead of branding them thugs and worthless leeches.
