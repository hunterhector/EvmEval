Actually, he told his father, who told him to tell Paterno, THEN he told Paterno the next day. Who waited a day before telling his boss, who waited a week before telling his boss, who didn't do anything of merit apart from taking the keys to the locker room away from Sandusky.

edit: Also, the GA didn't just witness a child being molested. It really needs to be stated that what the GA saw happening was full anal intercourse with a ten-year-old boy. The fact that it was then euphemized as "some horseplay in the showers" by administration officials is something that really outrages me.

According to McQueary that is exactly what did happen - have you not read the indictment?

I didn't read it. Did the kid say anything? Did McQueary have eye contact? If so and McQueary walked out, he should be fired as well.

I think you mean "Paterno". At any rate, according to the GJ report the boy and McQueary did make eye contact when he saw the boy being raped.

Yes, my bad. Gawd knows why I don't catch those typos, I try to re-read posts after I post them but I still seem to make lots of errors.

The kid has never been identified, so we only have McQueary's word for it. And McQueary says that both the child and Sandusky made eye contact, and saw he was there.

Read the testimony. Very little is left to the imagination... and there is precious little room for interpretation.

McQueary said Sandusky and the kid saw him but he didn't say there was eye contact. I mean, saying they saw him could mean eye contact or it could mean no eye contact. Just clarifying, in case it matters.

I think it is likely there will be some fakers... actually very likely...I speak from the experience of my own province.

This will cost the University at least 100 million. There will be a huge pot of money there and people will do almost anything for money.

Penn State loyalists should not worry about the school's bank account. All it takes to refill the cache is a few dot-com billionaire alumni who still care deeply about their alma mater. Note the Jesuits on the west coast are still living high off the hog despite the many bankruptcies supposedly resulting from the claims of their hundreds of rape victims.

Most research so far has refereed pedophilia as a 'paraphilia', which essentially means getting off on sick and abnormal things and situations. I've read that some professionals have called pedophilia a sexual orientation because, just like 'homosexuality' and 'heterosexuality', it is usually stable and is formed early in the sexual development. Notwithstanding whether calling pedophilia a sexual orientation is in anyway good and informative, this naturally causes all kinds of controversy because it includes such freakish monsters with "normal people" and how it supposedly 'normalizes' pedophilia and child-molesters. A common theme is that people started to make homosexuality acceptable then later it will be pedophilia and then it will be...the end of society?&lt;snip&gt;

So pedophilia is not considered a result of a developmental disruption (like rape or molestation as a child) and therefore preventable? I was so hoping...

I assumed that was what happened to Michael Jackson.

I don't know about paedophilia generally, but wrt pederasty in particular I read one article somewhere that said it was caused by an extreme form of sexual narcissism. Its basically love of an idealised, younger version of the molester's self.

So I suppose it would be caused by similar things to those which cause Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I'm not sure though, I'd have to look the article up.

They must be considering children in images and videos the pedophile looked at in order to arrive at 200. That can't be the number they physically touched.... if that's what you read there is no way that is true.

You know how you read something, and a half-formed thought comes immediately to mind?

My half-formed thought was...has it then been incorrect all this time that some victims become abusers? Does that then never happen? I've heard that it does, all my life it seems. But if pedophilia is an orientation, like homosexual or heterosexual or bisexual...then victims don't "become," do they?...or do they? Or what? <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>
