The historical cliche is that as the economy suffers, so politics becomes polarised and people begin to search for irrational explanations for the cause of their misery; people need someone to blame. Nazi Germany is often given as the shining example of this - "it's the Jews! Blame the Jews!"

There are obviously many important differences between 1920s Germany and 21st century Britain.

- Germany was raped far, far harder than Britain has been;
- the welfare state was completely falling apart leaving people facing homelessness and genuinely terrifying living standards;
- unemployment was something ridiculous like 8 million;
- we're arguably far more tolerant (some would say too tolerant) and educated than 70+ years ago;
- Communism has gone from being a genuine threat to your life in in Germany, to being reserved for Bond films and textbooks today;
- We have a far more stable government;
- We haven't lived through a horrifying bloodbath of a war;
- Other stuff I haven't though about.

Has history repeated itself in any respect do you think? I don't really know so that's why I started this thread. I have noticed a lot of implicit and explicit racism on TSR from a vocal minority but I wonder if that's just always been there. I mean, haven't the Daily Mail and its readers been lambasting immigrants since the dawn of time?

Has anyone had any personal experiences of an increase in racial tensions at all? Do you see the BNP increasing their portion of the vote in the next general election? Is there anyone reading this who will consider voting BNP when they wouldn't have done so before?

Just wanted to hear some thoughts on what others think. Particularly the economic downturn's wider historical significance.

Europe and the UK are still far more prosperous now than they were in the 1930s. Unemployment levels are not as severe and there is still welfare protection unlike in the 1930s.

Also, the overall demographic of migrants in Europe today is overwhelmingly young, male, and competitive. The indigenous European population is more skewed towards the older (and female) demographic. Thus the Europeans are more likely to moan and groan than resort to violence and aggression (predominantly a young and male trait). Also, significant proportions of the 20-35 male population in major European cities are migrant men.

Well, to an extent they did. Certainly immigration has increased competition, especially for low-paid, low-skilled work, and the reciprocal benefits have largely been taken advantage of by well-educated white-collar workers who have had more opportunities to develop themselves and learn multiple languages. I'm all for a bit of protectionism when it comes to labour markets.

1) Yeah that's what I said.

2) Interesting point that I haven't considered before.

Yeah, that's a horrible and malicious attack which can't be condoned on any level.

But do you think it's fair to imply that all Asians and Blacks subject Whites to racist attacks? Are all white Texans members of the KKK? Are all Germans Nazis?

What?! You MAD? It exists. If it didn't their wouldn't be racial attacks.

Only recently in the news a Asian man in the UK ( loads of cases) was called "pa**" and stabbed to death.

The news has a tendency to exaggerate to catch your attention

I shall rephrase my last comment, there's no racism with intelligent people in our society

If you know someone who is racist then either do something about it if you can or ignore them, not worth your time

Yes I think so.

I remember basically being made redundant and my boyfriend as well, being told there are no more hours for us where we worked, so it is best to just resign and look elsewhere. In the week we were leaving about 4 new polish people were being hired in the same area that we were and them constantly being given overtime, which was a little strange. They were all friends of the Polish manageress.

Luckily, me and the bf lived with polish people at the time and he is foreign himself, but i can see how to someone else going through that how it would really irritate them and start shifting their mindset towards immigrants and stuff.
