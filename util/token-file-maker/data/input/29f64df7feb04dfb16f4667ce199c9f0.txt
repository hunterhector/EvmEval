today i got a letter from the hospitial with an appoitment for the 26th of may. i thought that i would of seen them a lot earlier than that, by then i will be 3 days off completing my 14th week and will be in my second trimester, i am kind of not happy either that i have to wait so long, i was hoping a lot sooner, i was told i would have my first ultrasound at 12 weeks and now it is looking like it wont be till 14 - 16 weeks or even further down the track, as i highly doubt they will give you in the first appointment.

this date just doesn't seem right to me, does it toy you?, when did you see a midwife?

i chose to see a midwife instead of going through GP's as that seem s the best option as everything is at the hospital.

I had my first appointment with a midwife at 10 weeks-its does seem a little late. I would call and double check and see when they usually see clients for the first time.

I saw them at twelve weeks. Only supposed to be one ultrasound at 20 weeks, but we had a scare at 15 weeks so I got one then, too.

With Marshall - 8 weeks (but my first was a preemie and she wanted to see me earlier than normal)

My current pregnancircumstances was our 1st appt.

I got a US with Marshall at 9-10 weeks for dating purposes and if I would of been more certain on this pregnancy, we wouldn't of had one. Since I didn't remember me LMP, did a US at 12.5 weeks.

Usually, there is only 1 US at 20 weeks with my midwife unless there are other circumstances.

ah ok, thanks ladies, tells ya what some people know, i thought the 12 week one was rountine and i was waiting for it so i could see everything is ok before we told people, no i have to wait till 20 weeks, that is gonna really hurt DH as he wants to shout it out now and i don't as the people left to tell i am not too fond of.

i still think 14 weeks is a bit too long, i am going to call up and complain that i want one sooner, i also though i would have one at 10 weeks to hear the heartbeat and i am not even gonna get that at this rate.

i am really not happy with the fact i may have to wait another 2 months for all of this stuff, i am already 7 weeks, almost 2 months soon.

Heartbeat at 10 weeks can still be hit or miss if it can be picked up. My last appt. (15 weeks) my midwife had to really search for it due to position and "deep uterus"

I first a doctor at 4 weeks, and a midwife at 8 weeks, but I'm in totally different country so I'm probably not much help at all.

Here it's not unusual to only see a doctor at 12-14 weeks.

I had my first doctor appointment at 10 weeks, then at 13 and today at 18.

I saw my midwife for the first time yesterday at 17w6days and she didn't found it odd that we were meeting for the first time and they actually thought it was my first prenatal visit ever.

So yeah!
