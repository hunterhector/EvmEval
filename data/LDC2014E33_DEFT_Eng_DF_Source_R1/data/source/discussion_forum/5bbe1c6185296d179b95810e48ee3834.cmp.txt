A bit of the header from the article:

Two people died Thursday, Oct. 8, following a sweat lodge ceremony at Angel Valley Retreat Center located down Forest Road 525B between Sedona and Page Springs.

Verde Valley Fire District personnel were called to the scene at 5:19 p.m. Crews found several victims who had been involved in sweat lodge ceremony. Approximately 48 people participated in the ceremony that lasted over two hours, according to VVFD reports.

I actually surfed in after a year because I wanted to hear the JREF side on this issue. No one appears to have posted about this yet. Apparently, the two folks that died paid nearly 10,000 dollars to attend the new age sweat led by two time Oprah guest. James Arthur Ray - a non-Native American, lead over 60 people into the sweat 'lodge'. 20 people became ill, and one more is still in critical condition tonight. An updated blog post about the story gives more details tonight and you can find that link listed below:

I just read about this story. It's a tragedy, and I also find it revealing that the New Age guru in question, Mr. Ray, has since left the state of Arizona.

From what I understand, it sounds like Ray didn't know what the hell he was doing, because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space. In addition, they covered the lodge with materials that didn't allow for decent air flow. Put all of that together, and you have a situation ripe for asphyxiation.

Apparently they are still wanting to question the guy. They said he was uncooperative. I don't know much about the laws on this but wouldn't it be negligent homicide or something? This would be an interesting story to keep up with.
