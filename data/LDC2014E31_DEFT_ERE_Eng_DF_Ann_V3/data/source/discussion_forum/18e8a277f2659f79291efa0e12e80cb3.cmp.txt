...actions by some of the protestors?

What Fox News/Republicans don't seem to understand is that the bigger a movement gets, the more trouble-makers it is going to attract. In other words, the trouble-makers at the OWS protests do not represent the movement itself. The OWS from the very beginning had a message of peaceful protesting. That is what the founders of the movement intended. Unfortunately, because the movement is leaderless and has become so wide-spread, some of them have gotten chaotic. That is a human-driven consequence; it is not because of the ideology.

I think it is reasonable to criticize the OWS movement as lacking clear goals and leadership. If it did have these qualities, I think more people would take their message more seriously. However, by that same rationale, it is unfair to criticize the movement itself for a few of the trouble-makers.

Let me put it this way: if the Tea Party had become as popular movement as the OWS has (not even close), would the movement have attracted the same kind of law-breakers we see at these OWS protests? The answer is absolutely.

Stop making sense.

The right-wing neocon whackjobs on this board only care about the small percentage that seemingly cause trouble.

They love Wall St's unfettered love of greed and capitalism. Accountability is something that happens in a CPA's office, not on Wall St. Don't you know that Wall St is responsible for creating all those jobs out there. Even when they create nothing, but just take massive fees for doing nothing, or, in the case of some CEO's get their 'rightful' hands on those multi-million dollar bonuses even if the stock tanks and the company makes a loss.

You know why?

Because most of them are like John Gotti - only in the sense they should have the moniker Teflon in front of their names - because nothing is ever their fault and nothing ever sticks.

Stock tanked? "Not my fault that the economy's going under. Didnt' see that coming. You want me to involve my lawyers if you don't pay me my bonus? Think of the bad publicity. NOT MY FAULT"

That's how they think. And the biggest irony here is, that all these neocon loons on this board that support them harp on about personal responsibility ALL the time - except when it comes to Wall St apparently. 'Cause it seems that because they create "all these jobs", they are somehow entitled to a free pass.
