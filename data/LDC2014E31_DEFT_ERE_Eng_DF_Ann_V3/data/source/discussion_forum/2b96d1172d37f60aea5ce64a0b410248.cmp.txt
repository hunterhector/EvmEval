You're an idiot. Loads of "far right" parties advocate high taxes, why? Because it's based on jealousy. Poor white folks blame their own poverty on the rich. Hitler had an extensive welfare state, the BNP would punish the bankers to the point of destroying what is quite possibly the only real money maker the UK has.

Lol banking is the only real money maker the UK has... well firstly that isn't true and secondly they pay a pathetically small amount of taxes anyway so provide next to nothing to this country.

They pay a small percent by the overage sum is huge. Where else does the money the government spend come from?

Do you really think that the West would lose to a bunch of countries that hate their own neighbours? India and Pakistan hate each other and then there is China who hate both. The Middle East would just be destroyed if it was a total war. If anything, the 'arrogance' would increase as a result.

There is no way in hell that NATO would lose to those countries.

Pakistan is no match for India now. And in the future Pakistan will be a mere annoyance than a real threat.

China and India may have their differences, but they'll never go to war with each other. They both stand to lose too much in the process.

China is already wrapping a fist around the West's balls by buying up their debt and forcing the west to be economically dependent on them. Very smart those Chinese.

India should eventually get in on the act, while weaning themselves off western investment, then when the time is right, they should use economic warfare to plunge western economies into chaos, crippling their financial power, and ultimately their military power. After a few months so the West will be very vulnerable.

We've had to endure your cr*p for generations. We're a patient people. We don;t have to rely on military power alone, and we can wait until the time is right.

are you aware that the arabs and whites were rival powers until the white europeans overtook following the renaissance?

millions of white christians were enslaved by arabs. spain, a white country was occupied by arabs for centuries. arabs conquered the old eastern roman empire, they attempted to invade europe for centuries, finally being repelled at the battle of le panto.

white people today and victims of massive levels of anti white violence all across the western world. america especially.

you are a racist.

Oh, I feel so sorry for the poor white people, they've had it sooooo bad.

Who the hell are the blacks, who were enslaved by whites to complain?

Who the hell are the Indians, who were enslaved and robbed blind by whites to complain?

They've been sooo bad to the whites over the years, haven't they? And it's not like Blacks and Asians ever suffer discrimination at the hands of whites, is it?

Poor whites. You have it so bad.

Idiot.

from all the other taxes businesses and people pay? Barclays paid £113m in corporation tax in 2009 if you combine it with all the other banks it doesn't even make £1billion so you are saying that in 2009 the only money the government made was £1billion?

Who is this 'we'?

Okay, China has the debt bought up, but if they were to be destroyed who would chase it up? India are no match for any Western country, not even Belgium. Are you going to send the slum kids to attack, or how about the frail women?

The West has far more economic and military power than the East, to suggest otherwise shows that you're delusional.
