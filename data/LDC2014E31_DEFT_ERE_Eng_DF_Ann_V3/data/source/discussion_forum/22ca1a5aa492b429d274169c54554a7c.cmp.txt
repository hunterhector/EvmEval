The details in this article aren't complete but the fact that the police won't release the 911 phone call tapes and the fact that the teen was unarmed, while Zimmerman already called the police is very disturbing.

According to the reuters.com article the police would have told Mr. Zimmerman to not get involved and wait for the police. I seriously doubt a 17-year old kid would even think about arguing with someone when they have a gun. And if an argument began you'd bet that the person without the gun would just stfu.

The disturbing fact is be that the shooter wasn't arrested and the police have not released the tapes

17 year old kid walking on sidewalk a little after 7PM
26 year old "self appointed neighborhood watch captain" reports to police that 17 year old is suspicious (for walking on the sidewalk between the hours of 7PM and 8PM)
Cops tell him we are on the way and to backoff.
26 year old continues to follow 17 year old (Driving at 2-3mph at night behind a person walking on the sidewalk)
17 year old, after noticing some guy is following him (at night, behind him..lights on) asks "Whats you problem"
26 year stops and exits vehicle.....
fight ensues
26 shoots 17 year old.

No charges filed against 26 year old.
