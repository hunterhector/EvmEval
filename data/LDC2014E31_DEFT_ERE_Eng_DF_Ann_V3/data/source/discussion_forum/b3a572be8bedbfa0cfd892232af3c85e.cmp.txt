I would say everyone was wrong about Bin Laden. But Clinton had eight years to do something substanive about the guy, from when the first WTC attack happened, to the bombing of USS Cole. And he did nothing. He let the guy walk out of the Sudan (after the Sudan had offered to turn him over) and into Afghanistan.

Bush on the other hand, wiped out most of his network, toppled the two regimes that Clinton said was aiding him (Iraq and Afghanistan) froze his assets, captured or killed most of his key subordinates. To the point that all he had left at the end was a house and his porn stash where he lived cowering in fear.

Really? Doesn't that say something about you guys, then? You don't stand by your principles, you comprimise them because you want to win. Which is, of course, why you lost.

Okay, Lumpy, I'm ready now. I'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy.

Has anyone been saying anything good about him? More specific than how smart he is? I haven't been paying attention to the whole thread. Lotsa noise in it. But if you have, could you summarize the high points?

What does Newt plan for the nation starting in 2013?

I'm ready to listen! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I was kinda asking for the beefs, there's beefs a plenty... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I haven't read the whole thread. I did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals. They seem to want to keep Republicans on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down.

I think Democrats have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise. They use religion as a weapon..it just not appropriate..

Sorry I can't summarize the high points...Sharks &amp; NY Islanders starts in 15 minutes..

I started my own thread for high points instead of beefs.

But it was royally hijacked. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/>

Hope it's a good game!

I'm flattered... and, most threads are..and, Sharks won on a bad ref call..and a goal of course.. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

No. Everyone wasn't wrong about bin Laden. Clarke was right. Bill Clinton was right. George Bush was wrong before 9/11. The people you're citing who attacked Clarke were wrong. They complained that Clarke kept coming in with his hair on fire---which means that he grasped the reality of the problem BEFORE 9/11. But in order to defend Bush, the right has been forced to attack Clarke for being overzealous...instead of having some degree of honesty and admitting that when Clarke's hair was on fire, Clarke was right.

Clinton was obsessed with bin Laden to the point that he was criticized for it.

As for Clinton passing on bin Laden, are you determined to bring up every right wing myth in existence in this thread? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Yes, it says that we are not rigid ideologues.

As for 'why we lost', that's pretty funny. Look at the crop of candidates that the Pubs have this go round....please, don't compromise your principles. Nominate Newt, and let him go down in flames. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_pray.gif"/>
