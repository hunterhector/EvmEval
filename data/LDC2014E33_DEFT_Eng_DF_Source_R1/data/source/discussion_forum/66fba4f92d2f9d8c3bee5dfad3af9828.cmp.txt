The lie was the poster's claim that Foxnews never ran with this story until after she was fired.

C'mon...grow up.

You angry leftists are so quick to throw not only the 'racist' accusation, but the word 'lie'.

Now, here you are challenged to prove the lie charge, and you are unable to do so.

Were I a leftist, I would, of course, accuse you of 'lying' with your charge, as it is clear that the video provided in post #14 is in no way a lie, nor could you misunderstand my post which indicated that the vid was dispositive as to Fox being fair.

So, I'll simply leave you with the brand of immature, angry, sophomoric, spittle-spewing, left wing janissary, infused with the desire to paint opponents with vituperation, rather than banter about the value of each others' ideas.

There, now, isn't that more literate than 'lying racist'...

what? you don't believe FOX NEWS?

FOX news says themselves that they REPORTED IT FIRST.

<quote>
The Agriculture Department announced Monday, shortly after FoxNews.com published its initial report on the video, that Sherrod had resigned.

Try to read the entire thread before post, as it will make you appear less silly.

The point here was not whether or not Fox News went with the story, but, that, in a fair and balanced manner, the Glenn Beck Show put the story in its correct context.

Note post #14 above.

Shirley Sherrod, we now know that her video was edited, yet it was played on Fox again and again. And when poor Shirley was forced to resign, Fox comes out with a report, just tonight, that Obama threw an "innocent" woman under the bus. Now, Fox says she's innocent. Only now.

</quote>

Except, you have zero evidence that Fox even played the clip until after the Administration forced her to resign over it. In fact, watching Fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.

Of course, you will continue to pretend Fox has been attacking her all along. But the fact is, you idiots fired her before anyone knew about the story.

Bill O'Reilly did this story on MONDAY.

Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying how difficult it was for her to provide assistance to a white farmer. The Factor's Check: "That is simply unacceptable.

When was she fired??

</quote>

According to her, Monday afternoon before Glenn Beck came on.

This is how the people on the right here treat truth.

This is why the right is destined to lose its ass.

No group can be so deliberately dishonest and win over the American voter.

They cheat in elections, they lie about nearly everything and hate everyone who varies even a little bit from what they already have cemented in their brain cases.

They are killing themselves as a politcal force.

I don't know about that. You lie through your teeth and still get votes.

Or, what, then, was the lie?

Since Foxnews has admitted running the story before the announcement of the resignation,

you are wrong.

The USDA and the NAACP should have verified the story before they jumped the gun and threw Ms Sherrod under the bus.

They only checked it after they drove that big ass bus over Ms. Sherrod.

Then, Golly Gee, Whoops, they found the story was taken out of context. OOOPPPPSSS.

Now of course its everyones fault but their own.

Always easy to blame others for your ineptitude.

Typical. Jeeze.

</quote>

HMMMM, I cant help but notice you left out Fox news, they dont have to verify the "news" they put on the air?

</quote>

Hmmm. YOu must have seen Zona's post on the other thread. How original of you TM. LOL

But what does one expect from you?? You wouldn't have an original thought if it hit you in the face.

As for Fox. They screwed the pooch on this story. They aren't the first news organization to do so. Nor will they be the last.

Lets just hope in future folks get it right before they open mouth and insert foot and fire someone without verifying the story. Jeeze.
