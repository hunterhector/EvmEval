Does ANYONE know what is happening with the court battle over the Capital lockdown?

I've checked several news sites and am finding nothing...

They had hearings today, what came of them?

Hearing resumes @ 1 tomorrow. Lots of testimony. Interestingly, both sides rejected an offer to order the remaining "sleeping" protesters out of building. Followed 2 tweeters, one @ACLUMadison. Nothing decided yet, but interesting testimony, at least from the twitter feeds.

Why would Walker's cronies reject an offer to order the "sleeping protesters" out of the Capitol?

Don't get me wrong - I'm glad the protesters are still in the Capitol. But I don't understand their logic.
