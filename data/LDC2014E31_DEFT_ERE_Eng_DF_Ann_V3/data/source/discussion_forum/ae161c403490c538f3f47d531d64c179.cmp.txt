Yes he did look away! Looking away is exactly what he did it is in the indictment document! (See bottom of page 6 and top of page 7.)

As for the lack of empathy, I base my opinion on his subsequent actions which showed no empathy for the boy he witnessed being raped (the lack of informing anyone but his manager, the way he did not try to find the boy or identify him so that the victim of the rapist could receive the help they needed, his lack of curiosity about why a child rapist was still allowed on the premises and so on). How have you come to the conclusion that he had empathy for the victim of the rapist?

See my response to Darat, above. In 28 years, you're told like a zillion times to respect authority, mind your own business, let the adults handle this, what you think and feel is not important, etc., etc., etc. You are probably not told even once what to do if you see a man raping a child in the shower.

But unless you are an idiot, you can figure it out based on the following two facts that you do know:
Raping a child is a crime The police are in charge of handling crimes
That's it.

Further, as someone who works at a public university, I will assert with some confidence that he was, in fact, told exactly what to do in this situation. On day one, I was told in no uncertain terms that it was my duty to inform both my supervisor and the campus police department of any suspected illegal activity I witnessed, and that failure to do so would lead to disciplinary action, including possible termination. I find it difficult to believe McQueary was not told the same or similar.

So someone could see a man raping a ten year old and not understand what they were seeing? What else could this possibly have been? Again, you are trying to interject an ambiguity that does not exist.

Child rape is terrible. It is not incomprehensible. If what was seen was an alien raping a ten year old while making pancakes, then yes, that in fact would have defied human comprehension. It is not incomprehensible, particularly since we know that child rape exists. It is not outside our rhealm of knowledge of possible human behavior.

Maybe it's like how the native Mesoamericans couldn't see the Spanish ships, since they'd had no experience with them. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

Hey, he said he felt bad about it! Isn't that enough?

He didn't look away and he did have empathy for the victim. 28 years old sounds old but it isn't.

28 is an adult. I just turned 30. By the time my husband was 28, he'd fought in a war. I'd been married for 3 years, and half my friends had had children.

28 is not 12. 28 is not young enough to have an excuse not to act.

Well I'm sure it is a great comfort to the victim that the man who looked at him, saw him being raped, and walked away without calling the cops was "distraught and upset."

I'm sure that makes the rape much less rapey now.

Oh boo hoo, not as much as the boy he abandoned after he looked him in the eyes. I feel no sympathy and do not believe his crocodile tears. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>

Steve Spurrier is the head football coach at the U of South Carolina, the state your info says you're in, and he was a famous coach at the U of Florida before that, so I was just seeing how far your lack of familiarity of famous football figures extended. Overall Paterno is more famous than Spurrier but in the state of South Carolina maybe Spurrier is more well known.

He was a much beloved coach for University of Florida.

I know this only because I went to University of Florida while he was coaching.

Go Gators!

Mike McQueary is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the Penn State family. Son of prominent local businessman, star quarterback for the local schools, eventually Penn State quarterback. If there was ever someone destined to spend their life on the sidelines with Paterno, it was him.

That explains a lot.

LOL, I had no idea. Like I said I have no idea about football. I don't watch sports, I'll play, but I never watch them. Sad thing is I was a Gamecock <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>.
