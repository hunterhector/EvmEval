I wonder if Jeb would bow before the the Saudi Monarch, hold his hand, and walk on grass so that the filthy muslim dictator could use the concrete sidewalk like your tyrannical hero George the II did?

Of course he would. The Bushes have been in bed with the Saudis for decades. Why do you think Bush let all the Saudis get out of the country on chartered jets so fast after 9/11?

He's as good as. Maybe even better because he knows how to run a big state. Florida did well while he was Gov.

And Jeb's executive experience would come in handy as a Senator... how?

Ya got it scrambled:
His senate experience will compliment his executive experience for the next rung on the ladder. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Hell, America just elected a junior Senator with zero executive experince.
Just think how better qualified Jeb would be!!

This speculation is a great way to waste time on a forum, but in reality it makes zero sense. Consider:

If you are not already rich, becoming Senator can/will lead to riches, but the Senate is a stepping stone to the presidency if you are a very, very rich person with political ambition. Jeb is no dummy. He knows that America won't elect another Bush as President. So why would he ever want to deal with any of that nonsense, moving to Washington from Miami, dealing with the little people voters, taking a MASSIVE pay cut... for WHAT?!?

My logic is unassailable on this one, folks.

((My logic is unassailable on this one, folks....)).. to bad it didn't show up..

It's usually Governors that end up Presidents..

I don't believe most Americans are that familiar with Jeb Bush and I don't see why a run for the Presidency is so far out of the question...

Jeb Bush or Obama... I'd be going Jeb...who wouldn't?
