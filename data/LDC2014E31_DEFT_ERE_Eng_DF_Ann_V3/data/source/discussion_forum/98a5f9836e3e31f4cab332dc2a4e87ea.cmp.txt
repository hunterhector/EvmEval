Once again, Cali-Girl displays not only willful ignorance, but a insipid stubborness regarding her ignorance.

The Sunday Mail is a standard MAJOR paper in Australia...90 years and standing. I knew this from years ago, but dumb toots like Cali-Girl could have easily googled such. I'll break my rules and do her homework for her just this once:

Murdoch, the son of Sir Keith Murdoch (18861952), a famous Australian war correspondent and publisher, studied at Worcester College, Oxford (M.A., 1953), and briefly worked as an editor on Lord Beaverbrook's London Daily Express, where he first gained practical experience in the sensationalist journalism that would be a major influence early in his career as a publisher. His father having died, he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance, the Sunday Mail and The News, both of Adelaide

No one is denying Murdoch's successes, but a "self made man" isn't handed TWO successful newspapers to start building his empire.
Like all ignorant neocon/teabagger blowhards, once Cali-Girl is proven wrong, she suddenly states that she doesn't care about the very subject she so ardently sounds off about. But again, only a complete idiot would try to make The Sunday Mail the equivalent to a local Penny Saver.

But that's our Cali-Girl...who's beating the dead horse of my error in putting Australia in the UK despite my conceding and admitting such. Probably the only orgasm the little fool will have this year. Carry on.

You're 'probably' an overly emotional whiner.

Truthfully, I don't give a rat's ass what Murdoch inherited - it's not my business. However, you seem to have an unhealthy interest in other people's lives. How sad.

Ahhh, the final gasp by a defeated neocon/teabagger toadie! Riddle me this, Cali-Girl...if you don't give a rat's ass about the subject at hand, then why devote so much time and effort in trying to disprove what I wrote? Why do you stubbornly keep parroting the same old Limbaugh lines when you KNOW you've been logically and factually proven wrong? Are you having a psychotic break? Fucking stupid? Stubborn AND Fucking stupid? Or do you just have an axe to grind with me personally? Tell you what, if you truly don't care, then STFU, put me on IA and save yourself the trouble. But if you don't, then my assessments of you are pretty much on target, and I won't have to waste any more time on you on this thread. Adios, muchacha!

The only thing I questioned - and rightly - was your comment that Australia is in the UK. Twit.

There is no evil conspiracy here. Fox News has been proven to be more fair &amp; balanced than Liberal Media outlets. Just take a look at the number of Liberal/Socialist commentators they have on air. Someone posted the list earlier. Maybe they could post it again? And Murdoch is an incredibly successful businessman. I don't see how anyone could deny that.

As you can see by this link, Paulitician is just some clown with an axe to grind who just regurgitates right wingnut talking points and mantras just to be part of the conversation and push along the right wingnut presence. Just ignore this clown, folks.

The chronology of the posts makes Cali-Girl out to be a bald faced LIAR. And if that weren't enough, there was this from the previous response:
