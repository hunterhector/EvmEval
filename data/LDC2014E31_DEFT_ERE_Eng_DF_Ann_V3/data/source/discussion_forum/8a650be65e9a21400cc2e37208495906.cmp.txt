You are funny! Here is what goes on in just one the US city, Denver:

2/27 – Police shot and killed a suspect in a neighborhood a few blocks from the Country Club. Investigators said the man was wanted for parole violation.

4/28 - Police kill a drunk, knife wielding man (think about this! 3 or 4 cops with 9mms against a mentally distraught man? Come-on!)

6/2 – Police kill a man for displaying what “appeared to be a gun” (toy) while playing cops-and-robbers with is cousin.

6/23 - Police shot/kill resident who was chasing an intruder with a shotgun.

7/23 – A 56 year old homeless man was killed by “excessive force” while being subdued by sheriffs at Denver jail. The weight of the five officers along with the Tasering was determined to have caused the death.

8/2- A 62-year-old man who was threatening to commit suicide was shot dead by Denver police officers.

8/20 - Denver police pulled over a car for running a stop sign. A man, walking his dog, tells the driver that was pulled over, that he saw him stop at the sign. The police then beat the witness not knowing they are being filmed by a third person. (it’s on Youtube) A few states have passed laws making illegal to video police encounters.

8/24 The Denver Police Department quickly closed the internal-affairs investigation. The investigation was reopened the closed internal-affairs investigation of the 8/20 beating. The reopening was deemed necessary only after an outcry, especially from Latino groups and additional witness came forward.

9/10 - Police say a distraught man calmed down after officers used an electric stun gun on him. After he was then handcuffed, became out of control again and was Taseded again. The man was then taken by ambulance to Denver Health Medical Center and pronounced dead. Police say that's a standard practice whenever a TASER is used.

9/23 - Police drag University of Colorado business graduate into the hallway of his apartment building and beat him after he asked the officers for a warrant.

9/10 – Reported in local newspaper; Denver ranked #1 in misconduct according to the National Police Misconduct Statistics and Reporting Project. Comments by a department head included, "Our use of force per arrest is less than most major police forces."

12/4- Police in suburban Denver say a robbery suspect was unarmed when he was shot and killed by SWAT team members. The Denver Post reports that SWAT team members encountered Berlin in a stair well of an apartment building after the theft. The Twenty-seven-year-old man died of four gunshot wounds. Investigators say he was suspected of stealing a cash register earlier in the day.

A protest/march was publicized and organized to protest the killing by and misconduct of the officers of the Denver Police Dept. Here is the KICKER: As reported by local news stations DOZENs of protestors showed up to protest. Dozens huh?

Killing in the US is just part of day-to-day life in the US. It's just who we are as a society. Even when we invade an unprovoked foreign country and are responsible 130,000 + lives, there will always be people like you who believe you government, it's agents and hired mercenaries are heroes. Someday your government my just play "hero" with your life.

And yet cops and firefighters, as emplyees of government, are under attack because of their pay and benefits.

Here's an novel idea:If you don't like the idea of being shot at, don't become a cop. If you don't like the idea placing yourself in danger, don't become a firefighter. If you don't like the idea of being sent to a foreign land where people want to kill you, don't join the military. Wow, I wish I would have thought of that!
