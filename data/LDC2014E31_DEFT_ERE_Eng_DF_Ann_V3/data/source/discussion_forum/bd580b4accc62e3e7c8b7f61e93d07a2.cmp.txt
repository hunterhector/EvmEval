First, your claim about what "alot of guys [ sic ]" think is an unfounded assertion, and as your intent is to suggest that i think the same, it also constitutes a strawman.

Additionally, if Libby were to be incarcerated in a Federal prison, there is no good reason to assume that he would be tortured.

If you want to puke up your hatred for your imaginary "librul" enemies, carry it somewhere else where it might be on topic--maybe the Freepers have a special forum for people who failed to complete grammar school but still should have the chance to exercise their right to shout stupid things.

Setanta, you need a sense of humor. It would help you tremendously. I suggest you try it tomorrow. I must admit though that for humor to work, it must start with a basis of truth, then expand on it for the humor.

Commuting the sentence was the right thing to do. Libby was convicted and by not pardoning him, he still has the conviction on his record and yet he gets to stay home. Good for him.

And he still has the chance to clear his name through future court action.

Well, alot of you guys feel so sorry for terrorist suspects and want them turned loose, so I thought surely you would be in favor of the family man, Libby, being excused from suffering likely torture in a prison somewhere?

Libby was duly convicted in a court of law, with access to the best lawyers and all the human rights guaranteed to the rich and unfluential.

I guess that means he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

A tad different from people deliberately sequestered from all rule of law and, tortured, and considered guilty no matter what.

But I guess you wouldn't understand that sort of thing.

I don't know much about the case, but commuting Libby's sentence strikes me as horribly wrong and inappropriate, since Libby was associated with the administration. Far better for a president to do this for a stranger than for someone he knows personally. The man was convicted of a crime and doesn't deserve any special breaks because he was on the inside of the administration.

You wouldn't know humor if it bit you in the ass. And yes, humor works best with a grain of reality. That's why your "alot of you guys" horseshit doesn't qualify--and that's why suggesting that you book into a rubber room at Free Republic does qualify.

Though I tend to agree with you Brandon, I do think the length of the prison sentence was a bit long. As far as Bush commuting the sentence, other presidents have done the same or more for people they have ties to or are beholden to, so nothing new.
