Clay - if you are talking about a FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery shipment, then you need to escalate your complaint with FedEx Customer Service. Ground/Home drivers are private contractors, and if customers are having issues with a driver, FedEx wants to know about it. The company is very serious when it comes to exceeding customer expectations.

The fact that you indicated they are not open Monday tells me this is a Ground/Home Delivery shipment - Express delivers seven days a week, altho there are surcharges for weekend deliveries. Ground/Home deliver Tues thru Sat... and they are supposed to confirm a date/time for redelivery if you contact them. All of my clients that were not home were able to do so -- I required signature for delivery, so the packages could not be left at the door, door tag or not.

Sounds like you have either an overworked driver or one who's not fully "with the program". Either way, keep FedEx CS in the loop and let them know they are not meeting your expectations. They cannot fix what they are not aware of.

Talked to Fedex again this morning about the package.

On the Second attempt they tried to deliver the package to the wrong address 14835 instead of 14855.

I am lucky that the package required signature or else it would have shown delivered.

I hope I never have another package shipped via Fedex. They are incompetent. I blame Tom Hanks who is on a deserted island with my package that has gold wings on it. I hope Tom Delivers it Tuesday (They do not home deliver on Mondays....I guess they are 8th Day Advocates)

Dare to dream, and then dare to begin.

I prefer USPS but have seem to have had issues the last couple of weeks. Sent a couple of glass items to Washington and California, double boxed and they arrived broken which I hadnt had broken items in about 6 months. Then I have had instances where 2 people have not received their items but that is because they had P.O. boxes and the item delivery was attempted. Then I just had a lady complain about shipping being 13.49 to California for 8 cups/8 saucers. Wanted me to ship priority but she paid for parcel. Also complaining it took so long which I thought a week was good for California. Anyway seems nobody is happy. Had more crappy customers in the past week than I have had all year. For me UPS on large dish orders works good. Fed Ex is high, never used them. Out of all the years I may have had a couple of lost items. One to Japan and the other was the states. Still USPS is my choice shipper, because of cost and proximity to my home and hours.

they all have their issues.
-usps will lose your package and not scan it.
-ups will kick it all the way to the buyers door
-fedex will leave it at the house nextdoor
so you just gotta go with the most cost effective.
