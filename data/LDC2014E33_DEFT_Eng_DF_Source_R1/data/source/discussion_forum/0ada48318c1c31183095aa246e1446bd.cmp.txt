Commentary
You beg my pardon
Libby is not the only one who could benefit from Bush's clemency

By David Martin
Published July 5, 2007

President Bush has commuted part of the sentence given to Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, eliminating his prison term. Hard on the heels of this Solomon-like decision, the president has decided to issue the following pardons:

Paris Hilton

"I think it is tragic that Paris Hilton had to spend any time in jail. Just because she had a small problem related to drinking and driving is no reason to throw the book at her. Heck, if we took such a harsh stance in every such case, it's no telling who might have ended up in jail. And while we're at it, I want to pardon Ms. Hilton for her first CD. I think we've all suffered enough."

Barry Bonds

"It's tough playing baseball. I know. I used to watch these guys when I ran the Texas Rangers ball club. So if Barry needed a shot or two of something to keep going, I don't think he should be punished for that. Plus, just like my win in 2000, there's no need to put an asterisk after Barry's name when he finally beats Hank Aaron's home run record."

Dick Cheney

"People are saying he did a lot of bad things like shooting a guy in the face, invading Iraq and making me appoint John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. I'm not sure about any of those. Plus, I'm kind of scared of him. So I think it's just best to pardon Dick and hope that he'll leave me alone."

Britney Spears

"That nice young lady also deserves a pardon. Everybody seems to be picking on her for going a little wild after her divorce. These things happen. If we imprisoned every young woman who did crazy things, Laura and I would be posting bail for Jenna and Barbara every other weekend."

My dad

"Yeah, he screwed up and should have finished the job in Iraq when he had the chance back in 1991. While I'm at it, I'm pardoning him for any role he might have had in Iran-contra just in case the statute of limitations hasn't run out on that one. Hey, we all did some crazy stuff back in the '80s, but that doesn't mean we should have to pay for it forever."

Miscellaneous

"While I'm at it, I'd also like to pardon some other people including all those folks who gave me bad intelligence about Iraq. No real harm was done so I don't think they should be punished. I'd also like to pardon all those comedians who kept making fun of the way I talk. Rest inured, I will not persecute them to the full extent of the law. A quick pardon too for anything starring Sylvester Stallone. As for the Dixie Chicks, they'll have to wait for the next president. After all, I do have my limits."

This commutation also sets a bad precedence for future presidents. It's bad enough they're supposed to be the enforcer of laws, but when they override established laws to protect their cronies, that's a very dangerous practice for any government.

I'd say the precedent was set when the Democrats gave Clinton a pass for lying under oath.

I can't blame Bush for following their precedent.

No,the predecent was set when Bill Clinton PARDONED Henry Cisneros,AFTER he was convicted of lying to the FBI.

Cisneros pled guilty to a single misdemeanor. Even you have to know there is a difference between a misdemeanor and a felony.

It's called the legal system. When you can show me where Clinton was convicted of perjury then you might have a comparison. Until then you are doing nothing but making allegations that are unproven. The prosecturor didn't even indict Clinton let alone get a conviction. I am all for the legal process doing its work but to claim someone is given a pass by those of a political bent when there is no prosecution shows your bias. The process is run by the prosecutor. If you think Clinton was given a pass then you have to lay it at the door of Starr and Ray and no one else. They felt there was not enough evidence to convict him let alone indict him.
