Thank you all for your input. I have had such a day
I have cried so many tears, shouted at people who care about me and accepted hugs off my family.
I'm stuck in the family home and want to get out as soon as possible after Christmas. I always thought the house had to be sold before you could divorce.

I went and saw my MUM and Dad today and Dad is coming to the CAB tomorrow to get the ball moving about divorce etc............. I just needed the courage to ask for his help as he is very 'old sch'.
I know he will do all he can to help me. We made up a list of what I should tackle first some of which I will do tonight as some is needed for tomorrow.

Sandhawk - you are right, you do need help and support. I am glad that you are getting in from your family, but if you think your GP is sympathetic then I think you really need to speak to them and ask for emergency access to support. I am not sure what is out there (many more knowledgeable people than I post here) but if you stress to the GP exactly how bad it is on your worst days then he or she may be able to get you some urgent help.

Also, are you a member of a church or faith? Even if you are not a churchgoer, churches are often good places to go for support, if you can accept that their viewpoint will be that of their faith.

Some places like Relate charge for counselling but on a sliding scale. Relate is not just about keeping a couple together. They will see people on their own and help people to come to terms with the end of relationships. I am sure the counsellors there have seen so many manipulators and the fallout that they may be able to suggest strategies to cope.

Wishing you all the luck in the world.

Went to see CAB today to find out about seeing a solicitor to start the divorce rolling. Also asked about getting an injunction against him they gave me the number for womans aid to get help with obtaining one. Waiting forthemtoget back to me. He has texted the house phone last night and all the kids.

WellWomen Aid rang me this morning and we went through the forms over the phone to take out an injunction on him to stop him coming anywhere the house and contacting me. When it came to see if I was entitled to legal Aid, apparently I'm not I would have to pay £97 a month for the solictiors to do the work and £100 when it goes to court. I just havent got that sort of money esp just before christmas.
The wind was really taken out of my sails, I feel so let down hurt, angry I just don't know what to do now..........
