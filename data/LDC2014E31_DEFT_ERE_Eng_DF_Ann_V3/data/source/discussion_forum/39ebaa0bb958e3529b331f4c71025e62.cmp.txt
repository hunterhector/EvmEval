You really believe that the impeachment was on solid ground?

Legally. Yes. Clinton broke several federal statues. People have gone to prison and lost their jobs for a lot less.

Politically. Not so much. He was still popular and the country was willing to forgive him and frankly, his being acquitted was a forgone conclusion. If he had Obama's economic numbers, he'd have been run out on a rail.

The millage that could have been gotten out of it was gotten when Ken Starr nailed down that he lied. They should have censured him and left it at that.

Oh gosh.

But I agree with your conclusion.

no, YOU made the accusation that the quotes are racist or bigoted. So YOU put them INTO CONTEXT and justify your opinion that they are racist or bigoted. Sallow did not do that with the highly biased and bigoted links he posted.

They are in context.

Exactly. Sexual harrassment lawsuits from malingerers cost $$$$. That's part of the equation. Glad you are finally getting it, I was beginning to think you were stupid.

Oh, give it up. They go for very cheap labor. Yeah, I'm sure that includes getting sexual favors for free from workers, but that's just a bonus.

You can go there and accuse all the women you like of putting pubic hairs on your coke can, and then carry on about how they should grow up.

But she got millions AFTER she stuck the knife in. Amazing.

Are you gifting her with psychic abilities?

All she got at the time was trouble and humiliation, and the possible permanent loss of employment in her chosen field.

She took the risk because she had no choice. And somehow, you put that on her. Which is crazy.

Then they should stop whining about it. Actually, no one believes them because they usually end up suing for bullshit. Frankly, never saw a SH case brought that wasn't complete BS, but good people got fired for petty BS because HR departments are running scared. True, they later find ways of getting rid of the malingerers, because that's just a bomb waiting to go off.

You poor thing.

Being that you were completely wrong on the last three, and wrong on Hill being a
Again, you ignored the issue. Obama called his grandmother a racist on national TV because he couldn't bring himself to denounce the nasty, anti-American racist bile pouring out of the mouth of his pastor. The woman who raised him when his parents couldn't be bothered.

Seems a lot worse than getting divorces from marriages that aren't working to me.

Absolutely not.

Obama made a point that went way over your head.

The point that we all have racial bias that slips through at times. All of us. Every one of us.

To be a racist is a far more concentrated effort.

Joe, the links about Newt are in an earlier thread.

READ THEM.

You'll find out about the child support, and the tendency to dump wives when they get sick, and the serial adultery.

But you're right, the second wife was a lobbyist.

Now go read the rest.

Thanks.

Well, I did. Far left kook websites letting an jilted ex-wife break bad don't count. And you did get the facts wrong about so many other things....

And you got one wrong AGAIN (bolded)&gt; Callista is the THIRD wife, not the second... Again, do you bother to do ANY research before wasting my valuable time?

Get your FACTS right before you shoot off your mouth.
