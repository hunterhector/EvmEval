That case is only one example of a systemic problem that pervades the entire criminal justice system.

Hell, I didn't even mention the fact that rich people can afford better legal counsel. After all, do you think O J Simpson would have gotten away with murder in the 90's without his 'dream team'?

I am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since...well, mankind got 'organized'. Who wrote "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others," and when did he write it?

justice is sometimes a matter of simply, what you can afford. It has always been so.

I think you're missing the entire point. The founding fathers understood that there would be inequality. And as is often said, they weren't trying to make everyone equal. However, they DID strive to make everyone equal under the law.

The purpose of this thread is two-fold.

First, it's to dismiss the orchestrated idea that the wealthy in this country are somehow 'victims' of class warfare when talk is floated of raising their taxes to help tackle the deficit and debt at the very same time that massive cuts are on the horizon to tackle the same deficit and debt.

Secondly, it's to show that the REAL class warfare that exists in this country in the criminal justice system actually works in FAVOR of the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of the poor and the middle class.

Our country is supposed to be a nation of laws and not men, right? Then why is it that our political and financial elites get pardons for their crimes or their crimes aren't even investigated when a country like France doesn't have a problem putting THEIR former president on trial for corruption?

If our collective ideals are to have any real meaning at all, then we have to practice what we preach to others, and it's clear that we as a nation are not doing that.

When Ford pardoned Nixon, I think everyone believed (or at least hoped) that Nixon's pardon was a one time exception. Unfortunately, all it seemed to do is set a precedent for future pardons.

What is ALSO unfortunate, is that while our justice system has become ever more lenient toward the rich and powerful, it's has also become increasingly merciless to the poor and the middle class because as I noted in the OP, the US has 12.5 times as many people in prison today as we had in prison 40 years ago. And our population hasn't increased by over a factor of 10 in the last two generations.

That is the state of class warfare in our society. The rich aren't victims; they're beneficiaries in every sense of the definition.

I don't think that the wealthy are 'victims' of class warfare and I don't think that was ever the intent on using that phrase. It is the poor that are victimized by politicians that pit them against the rich. The rich are not going to notice the 5 percent that is taken from them in the name of the poor but in reality, nether are the poor going to notice it given to them. It creates a death spiral of take more and more without really noticing that they are getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing. The rich are never going to be the victim but the poor are being exploited by the politicians to take the ire from them and move it to a source of income for them to spend.

As far as uneven legal representation, that is a big deal and I am not sure how to further mitigate the problem. If people were really outraged by this it would change on its own but the fact is that people in general are apathetic morons and simply do not care.

Look at the pass people gave Polanski. Even HERE people were making arguments for him. Somehow, people see famous different than the normal guy.

I still haven't heard any suggestions for a better system.

A better jury set for starters and possibly a blind DA. One that makes the decition to hear a case without names involved or any other information other than the facts uncovered so far. That would be hard to do though.

Heh, they would have to serve a year in a closed bunker just to get away from the news reports but hey, the military already does that and they would not even be shot at <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

My favorite stories are the ones where public officials, or secretaries embezzle thousands and into the hundreds of thousands. When caught, they get probation and restitution and /or maybe a year in the county. Steel something from Wal Mart and see what happens. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/> you might as well have killed someone, they are throwing the book at you.
