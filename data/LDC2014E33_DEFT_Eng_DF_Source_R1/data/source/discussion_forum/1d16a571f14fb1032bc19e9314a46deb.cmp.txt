Worth highlighting what the Carbonite CEO said:

<quote>
No one with daughters the age of Sandra Fluke, and I have two, could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this courageous and well-intentioned young lady. Mr. Limbaugh, with his highly personal attacks on Miss Fluke, overstepped any reasonable bounds of decency. Even though Mr. Limbaugh has now issued an apology, we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising from his show. We hope that our action, along with the other advertisers who have already withdrawn their ads, will ultimately contribute to a more civilized public discourse.

I was going to buy Carbonite. (A computer crash not too long ago showed me that my present back up system sucks so badly that I lost my entire hard drive, data and I had no way to restore it all.)

Now I refuse to use that corporation's product. Carbonite is now off my list. Fuck them.

Fair is fair.

I'll go with one of the competitors.

Thanks for pointing this out. NOw I will go and sign up for carbonite.

This way you are irrelevant. See how this works.

Bullshit. You are an inveterate liar.

I was in the market. I doubt you are.

That's the difference.

In any event, even if you had told the truth (doubtful) and even if you were in the market, they still lose one customer to a competitor.

Fuck them.

Leave it to a brain-dead pussy lib to equate an apology with weakness

except of course when the dopey-assed President is the one who is constantly engaged in such behavior.

The amount of posts on this thread in such a short amount of time shows one thing for sure. That is Rush Limbaugh stirs the passions on both sides of the isle, which is why he's so successful. Like it or not he is "doing what he was born to do" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Sandra Fluke is not the first women to kick the shit out of Rush, Hillary did it first.
