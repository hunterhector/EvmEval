how did you know they would let GM fail, but not Ford?

Because Obama was not going to allow the car companies to fail on his watch. Carter had the same issue in '79 I do believe it was with Chrysler. He did the same thing, gave them a loan, and they paid it back in full with interest.

Can you imagine unemployment if those three went under? It'd be insane.

And the amount that the three combined were asking for was nothing like the banks. And the argument that "Well, this is where the jobs truly are" prevailed.

And a good way to determine the company's strength is to look at the Annual Report obviously. I hadn't taken a deep look. But I just knew politics would come into play more than business.

You are right. The media is stupid.

Reagan and the two Bushes created 92% of the National Debt by lowering taxes on the rich and increasing wasteful military spending.

And yet Republicans dishonestly claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility.

Why do they keep lying?

</quote>

Because people keep believing them.

The Big Lie of the Republican Party is the tax cut.

If you cut taxes and raise spending, you are actually raising taxes and passing the debt on to the next President.

I guess they don't want to accept the truth so they decided to take the thread off topic.

Oh well.

The thread isn't 'off topic.'

You missed something the rest of us were well aware of, and even were silly enough to make a thread about.

Well yes.

The main problem with Detroit was they were making cars that went against what America needed in a bad recession. So once the good times stopped rolling and people could no longer afford the gasoline on their hummers, what was going to happen? The obvious.

I have to say, one of the things that the Japanese do according to their traditions is to make use of every space in the car. That and saving gasoline is huge, especially now.

What you see now actually is Detroit is getting into farming more believe it or not. But it will likely not fully recover for a long time. A LONG time.

President Bush expanded the federal budget by a historic $700 billion through 2008. President Obama would add another $1 trillion.

President Bush began a string of expensive finan*cial bailouts. President Obama is accelerating that course.

President Bush created a Medicare drug entitle*ment that will cost an estimated $800 billion in its first decade. President Obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern*ment health care fund.

President Bush increased federal education spending 58 percent faster than inflation. Presi*dent Obama would double it.

President Bush became the first President to spend 3 percent of GDP on federal antipoverty programs. President Obama has already in*creased this spending by 20 percent.

President Bush tilted the income tax burden more toward upper-income taxpayers. President Obama would continue that trend.

President Bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008. Setting aside 2009 (for which Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for an additional $2.6 trillion in public debt), President Obamas budget would add $4.9 trillion in public debt from the beginning of 2010 through 2016.

As to... "Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?"

Answer - You didn't read the NYT or WaPo or the internet? You did not watch CNN or FOX News? In other words, what's this "we" stuff kemosabe?
