The famous sixteen words were taken out of the SOTU address Bush gave because the intell to back it up was not there. The Bush administration put them back in.

</quote>

The famous 16 words were correct. The British did have evidence the Iraqis were trying to buy uranium. MI-6 stood by that statement. So it was an accurate statement. they didn't get it, but they asked for it.

Look, guy, George Tenat went into Bush's office and said "It's a slam dunk, Mr. President!"

Joe Wilson wrote in the LA Times that no only did Saddam have WMD's, but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he'd use them.

This is a lot of people playing CYA when something goes wrong. If you had a real job, you see it happens every day in the business world, who ends up holding the bag of dog poop.

Wow, you have totally drank the kool-aid. Next, you're gonna tell us that Saddam was behind 9/11. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Myself. Saddam was a scumbag and I'm glad he's dead. Aren't you?

Not at the cost of over $1 Trillion and over 5,000 U.S. military deaths. HELL NO!!!!

I believe we lost that many to the days leading to D-day and at D-day. Back then it was a united country..today is weaker because of the self righteous press of Vietnam, Korea and relive a past

The only thing that was indefensible was Clinton's total sloth on the Bin Laden problem. If he didn't need a distraction, he didn't give a shit.

</quote>

This is a baseless claim, to distract from my point about Clarke.

</quote>

No, it's a dead on claim. He bombed the Aspirin factory in 1998 (which turned out to have nothing to do with Bin Laden) the week he revealed he had been lying to us for eight months about Lewinsky. Then he never, ever mentioned it again. Then Clarke, whom NON ONE EVER HEARD OF pops out of the woodwork and says, "I told Condi about Bin Laden, and she looked at me funny", when in fact, there are numerous taped interviews where it was clear Condi knew all about Bin Laden.

So Clarke did really nothing under Clinton, and whined that he didn't get a promotion after Bush took over.

Not even a good dodge. Answer the question- why didn't your side hold ONE Senator accountable for voting for the war on your own side?

</quote>

It's a good response to a really ridiculous comment. You seem to be holding me personally accountable for how all Democrats voted. Are you crazy? Desperate? What?

</quote>

No, it's not. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of your party colletively, not you personally. Collectively, your party nominated Kerry in 2004 because he voted for the war, and in 2006, you didn't vote out one Senator who had voted for it. Not one. You did try to go after poor Joe Leiberman because he ignored the "War Bad Now" memo. But even managed to survive as an independent.

Okay, make it easy for you. Explain why I should give a shit about any of it?

</quote>

Because you understand the basic nature of the nation that you live in.

</quote>

I do understand it. We have one party that does the bidding of the rich, and another one that is trying to make as many of us dependent on the government as humanly possible. So it's really a case of "choose your serfdom".

What nation do you think we live in?

By far the best debater and most informed candidate and could easily kick Obama's ass in a debate...

Turned Clinton from a deficit spending President in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and Democrat pro-sexual harassment hero..

Soo.. what's your beef with this Guy...?

</quote>

Okay, Lumpy, I'm ready now. I'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy.

Has anyone been saying anything good about him? More specific than how smart he is? I haven't been paying attention to the whole thread. Lotsa noise in it. But if you have, could you summarize the high points?

What does Newt plan for the nation starting in 2013?

I'm ready to listen! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I was kinda asking for the beefs, there's beefs a plenty... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I haven't read the whole thread. I did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals. They seem to want to keep Republicans on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down.

I think Democrats have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise. They use religion as a weapon..it just not appropriate..

Sorry I can't summarize the high points...Sharks &amp; NY Islanders starts in 15 minutes..
