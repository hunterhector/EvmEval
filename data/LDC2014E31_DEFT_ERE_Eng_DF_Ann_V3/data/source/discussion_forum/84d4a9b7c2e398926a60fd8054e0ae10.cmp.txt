I read here somewhere that Jane Norman had gone bust? I don't know if they are just closing the stores or both but I think you should see if they have a number you can call.
I would also call your bank.

They did indeed go into administration, but they've been bought up by the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, so all (as far as I'm aware) shops are open again and the website is up and running again - they're a bit behind with orders for a while but back to business definitely.

I would contact the customer services team if I were you (webenquiries@janenorman.co.uk apparently), and as RainbowDoll said, it's probably a good idea to give your bank a call and check if they can cancel it.
