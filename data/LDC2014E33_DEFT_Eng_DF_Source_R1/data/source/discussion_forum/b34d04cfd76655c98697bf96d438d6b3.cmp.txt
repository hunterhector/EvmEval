I know that their logic may have gone AWOL a bit when Madeleine went missing, but surely if you were that desperate to find your daughter you would do the most sensible things which would help lead you to her?

I bought their book as I was intrigued to understand the whole thing more, and to give something towards the search for her. But I am literally shocked with what I'm reading.

- In the beginning, loads of shrinks/psychics were sending in information about visions they had had where they thought she was. They used up time and resources and money actually following up some of these.
- they actually paid for a man who claimed he had a machine which could track madeleine down, to come out to portugal and find her. The machine included putting some of her DNA (hair and eyelashes) into a machine and she would be located by GPS. And they actually believed it.

Another couple of things I just found really weird is that when they left their kids in the apartment, they left the door open, the patio open, the blinds open, it was on a corner with roads directly next to two sides of it, it was on a ground level, with no barriers or anything around it. As a parent, if you looked at that apartment, what the heck would make you think that's safe ? Why would you leave your young kids in somewhere like that? Yes they were only a few yards away but one look away and it's enough time for some local to move his way in.

-they travelled extensively all over the world leaving their twins behind. I don't understand how if they lost one kid, how could they leave the other two behind all the time? Yes with trusted people, but my maternal instinct would be in overdrive and I wouldnt want them out of my sight.

This is exactly why there was so much controversy when the case first broke, people recognised that their behaviour was unusual for somebody who had lost a child. Maybe they are just odd people, but it didn't ring right.

Exactly the same happened to Joanne Lees in the Peter Falconio case, she was the girl who's boyfriend was murdered in the outback in Australia, and it came out that she was cheating on him with another guy at the time he was murdered, and then sold her story for many thousands of pounds....people judged her as being a bit odd.

And now you have got the business going on with Shrien Dewani about the murder of his wife, when all sorts of other murky facts are appearing about their circumstances at the time, so people suspect him.

I am not judging the McCanns and Kate McCann does look like a woman who is sufficiently traumatised to be genuine, but I think they did some odd things at the time, both before her disappearance and just after it.

They gave money to a man who claimed he could track her down by using her eyelashes to get a GPS lock on her? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

And these people are doctors? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/eek.gif" alt=":eek:"/>

The real issue here is what sort of con man took advantage of them by taking their money in that situation?

I don't think you understand what loosing a child does to you... You don't always think logically.

Had this happened to a single mother or a couple who lived on a council estate, they would have been prosecuted and the two other babies taken away, but no because they've got money...
