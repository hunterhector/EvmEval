I wish there was a way for kooks like you to be tagged so that we could quit protecting you from terrorists and not help you during natural disasters.

When you whine about the US military killing terrorists overseas, we could just single you out here for terrorists to find you while leaving us alone, because "you don't like your tax dollars killing terrorists overseas."

Also, we can just tag you and your personal goods for not being supported when a natural disaster hits your trailer. The Feds will just say, he didn't want us to find him a place to sleep after the tornado sent his trailer airborn.

What's the difference between wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay someone else's home insurance costs and wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay for Obamacare?

If millions have a disastrous medical issue, like cancer, or hundreds or thousands have a natural disaster issue, what's the difference? Shouldn't your "principles" lead you to support Obamacare?

If people need help, just assume charity and local gov'ts aren't enough and just tax everyone else to pay for it, what's the difference?

But... but... but... That's DIFFERENT!!!

If an ice storm takes down power in a state/city for awhile, causes massive wrecks, etc then many times Governors ask for Federal help.

Driving on an icy road and wrecking isn't a Federal problem until it affects thousands of people. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

A town being leveled is a wee bit more serious than you losing your car in a fog wreck. You can have 50 cars damaged in a wreck and it still doesn't equal the damage of people losing their town/homes/businesses/lives from a tornado going for miles.

Insurance will cover most of the damage but a town being gone causes havoc like loss of normal services to actually live. The Feds should only help the state and city officials get things stabilized then leave, not hang around like with Katrina giving out money to people.

What is the policy on federal disaster aid for tornado damage? Insurance should cover most losses. Are we going to cover multi-car fog accidents? I had ice storm damage last year. Where's my check?

The ice storm here was very widespread. No aid. So the government has a policy or just picking winners and losers?

Every winter driving on icy roads affects thousands of people.

Try again.
