Social Security has nothing to do with marriage.

</quote>

Actually Social Security does have something to do with marriage in the way it (SS) is administered.

Under the law, if a couple is Civilly Married for a prescribed number of years and one or both have been working adults and paid into Social Security, then upon retirement age if one of the spouses had died then the surviving spouse can draw Social Security based on the deceased spouses contribution if it is higher than their own in recognition of the family support entailed in Civil Marriage.

They did for my parents when one passed a number of years before the other.

Whether inheretance taxes should exist or not is a discussion for another thread. The reality is that they do exist and Civil Marriage brings with it large impacts on the transfer of property between spouses.

The military recognizes the family relationship established as a result of Civil Marriage and with it awards certain benefits as a result. One such benefit is a military member who has a spouse is eligible for either base housing or additional pay to help provide a place to live for that spouse. Another is that the spouse becomes eligible for health care under the military system and can use TRICARE for civil health care or can be seen at military clinics and hospitals. Another is that when the government orders a military member through Permanent Change of Station orders (PCS) to relocate from one place to another the military sponsors the spouse to travel and relocate to the new base with their spouse. For example when I was transferred from Tennesseee to Japan for 4-years the military paid for my spouse to accompany me and provided United States government sponsorship for my wife to enter and reside in Japan in accordance with the Status of Forces agreement between our two countries.

I agree when we in the military are willing to lay down our lives to defend our country, that when we are in a Civil Marriage all military members should be treated equally.

The same goes for private employers and taking care of their own.

I disagree, it is not the same with private employers. The military is not the same as a private employer, they are a government employer.

Well that is a different argument in a different place but "fair is fair". If not get the hell out of there. That has a lot to do with why I didn't reup after my 1st 3 years. I wanted to be free to tell someone to go to hell.

I don't understand how this responds to the specific points address about Social Security having nothing to do with marriage and about how Civil Marriage impacts military families.

So if marriage is between the individual and God. Then you would have no problem with the government recognizing as equal all religious marriages between individuals and God based on their individual religious organizations view on the subject correct?

That if a same-sex couple is married in a religious institution in accordance with their view of what God allows, that those marriages (which exist today) should be recognized equally with other religious marriages? Or should the government which cannot respect one religion over another under the 1st Amendment, be picking and choosing which religious views are valid. If the government is to be consistent, then it needs to recognize both, if the government can pick and choose then the governemnt is free to ignore Church doctrine and require Catholic organization to cover birth control under insurance.

Either government has to honor religioius doctrine or it doesn't - pick one.

(Personally, I don't have a conflict because their is no one "marriage" and Religious Marriage is separate from Civil Marriage.)

I don't think the government need to recognize anything as pertains to marriage. It is none of their business.

I can respect your right to believe that.

I just don't think that once people think beyond the platitude of it and start to examine closely what it means in terms of the 1138 Federal government laws (at last count), plus hundreds of more state laws, in which marriage was a component of federal and state recognized "rights, responsibilities, and privileges" and that if suddenly the government stopped recognizing the family relationship established under Civil Marriage and all that that would take away from the people.

The government stopping the recognition of a spouse will have a huge impact - one that I don't see you gaining a lot of support from heterosexuals for.

They say the hardest job in the military is being a military spouse and my wife was one for most of my military career. As a retiree she has medical benefits and arrangements have been made (which are ONLY available to a legal spouse) that she will receive part of my retirement check if I were to pass before she does so that she will have something to care for herself with. Government non-recognition of Civil Marriage means she would have no security in our elder years because while she raised our children while I was off defending our country she would have no access to my Social Security nor my military retirement.

Similar situations exist both in the government sector and the private sector - government not recognizing Civil Marriage is not something that will gain large support.

Not looking for support. Just stating my mind. All those things you mention are the twisted twine ball of the government. Of course my family is entitled to all I have earned when I am gone. It should be a matter of fact not a goverment regulation. Nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me.
