No it's just that people like you can't be honest. It is all about demanding those Taxpayer Freebies. Doesn't matter to me you wont admit that. But it is reality. Take a closer look at their signs and listen to what OWS is really saying. It is all about the Entitlements. They have their hands out and so does Wall Street. And they're not even occupying the right places anyway. They should be in Washington because that's where all the real problems are. OWS and Wall Street are just in competition with each other for their handouts. They stand for the same basic Entitlement philosophy.

Question. You truly believe that the people who have lost their entire LIFE in this economic meltdown by-way of foreclosure, as a direct result of the real sense of ENTITLEMENT and irresponsibility of investors, are in fact similarly motivated? I think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument.

AIG gets bailed out, then gives multi-million dollar bonuses in the very same year. That's entitlement.

Average American has his house foreclosed on by the very banks he is paying to bail out, and wants answers and recompense. Entitlement or accountability and justice?

Common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their third vacation home are the one's with entitlement issues. Not the people that want them to pay their share of the tax burden which they very much are responsible for.

Why did they lose their entire life? And why is that other Taxpayers' fault. You don't get to demand stealing from fellow Citizens just because your life didn't turn out the way you wanted. That's the same exact mentality Wall Street has. If your problem is with the Banks,then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them. I have no problem with that. But your real problem is still with Washington. They gave Wall Street all that Taxpayer cash. You guys are occupying the wrong places. Get to Washington. But don't demand your fellow Citizens pay for your own mistakes or problems with Banks. We're broke. The Entitlement Gravy Train is off the tracks and out of gravy.

So to clarify, bankers/investors/lobbyist take knowingly absurd risks and engage in frivolous and unwarranted spending with money people have entrusted them as their futures (home, retirement, college, etc). Then, the bubble bursts and we have to assign accountability. Ready, go... The lawmakers choice to bail out the banks is an entirely separate issue of accountability. That legislation was headed by Republicans under the Bush administration but was very partisan in nature, however measures of spending accountability were absolutely mishandled. But again totally different argument. Responsibility for the event lies with...?

Well see,there's your own Entitlement attitude slipping out. Just sounds like you're blaming everyone else for your own mistakes. That's just way too common in the OWS Movement. I'm not defending Big Banks that got Taxpayer Bailouts but Citizens have to be held accountable too. They played a big part in the economic collapse. Bad decisions and greed is what got a whole lot of Citizens in trouble too. But anyway,if you want to blame Wall Street for all your problems then go for it. Sue them and try to get some money out of them. But don't demand fellow Citizens/Taxpayers pay for your mistakes. The Gravy Train really is all out of gravy.
