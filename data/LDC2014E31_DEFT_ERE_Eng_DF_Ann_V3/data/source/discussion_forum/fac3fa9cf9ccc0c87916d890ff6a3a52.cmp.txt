Well, since I didn't see ONE democrat actually protest his December attack on Iraq (you know, the one we just had to do the exact same four days the House was holding impeachment proceedings), it stands to reason you weren't all that outraged at the time.

</quote>

That is pretty irrational. You're comparing a full scale invasion to one attack on a factory?

</quote>

Uh, once again, you get your facts wrong... and wonder why you are a joke. Operation Desert Fox was NOT just an attack on one factory. It was a widescale attack on hundreds of Iraqi facilities.

You are probably thinking of Operation Infinite Reach, which was an attack on Sudan and Afghanistan...

I know, it's tough. So many half-ass, ill thought out bombing raids to distract from his piccadillos, it's hard to keep track.

No, everyone didn't. Richard Clarke tried to warn the Bush administration repeatedly about bin Laden. The Clinton administration conveyed their concerns. Our intel knew that bin Laden had directed attacks from Afghanistan. Maybe bin Laden was news to you, but he wasn't news to me, and he sure wasn't to the administration.

</quote>

Clarke was part of the Administration that thought issuing an indictment for Bin Laden was calling it a day... He also tried to claim that Condi Rice didn't know who Bin Laden was, until they dug up a bunch of interviews that indicated she clearly did.

Misleading the public into war is as big a crime as I can imagine.

</quote>

And oddly enough, the Democrats never impeached anyone for that when they got control of Congress. In fact, Bush flipped them off and said, "Screw you, I'll escalating the war!" and they ran off like whipped dogs... Hilarious.

No, we're in to, "They suck at their jobs, but don't you dare say so or I'll call you a racist" territory. Judging by the way liberals treats black folks like Herman Cain and Clarance Thomas, I think we know who the racists are.... You minorities and women can only be successful when we say you can be.

</quote>

You are talking yourself into a circle. You're not racist when you baselessly insist that Hill is an affirmative action hire, but some imaginary liberals are racist if they criticize Thomas and Cain for specific, non-racial reasons.

</quote>

What specific reasons are those? Frankly, all I see is that you guys are made these men made it without the welfare state or the pity party...

Regarding signs at the Tea Party, there was a large sign of a concentration camp at a prominent rally in DC. Well known Republican politicians spoke at the rally. No, offensive signs were not necessarily taken care of. And I certainly saw a lot of those Obama as witch doctor signs at a lot of rallies, and I didn't see people being told to leave.

</quote>

You know what else you didn't have at the TEA Party rallies. The police didn't have to come in and arrest anyone. People weren't defecating in the street and littering the place. They cleaned up after themselves and left peacefully after they had made their point.

Unlike these dirty, filthy OWS people, who are now hoping for a "Kent State" moment to bolster their cause.

Oh, right. Because clearly, none of these guys who had been around Washington longer than Bush had knew anyone over at the CIA or Pentagon. Because they hadn't been looking at the same intelligence in the 1990's that said the same things.

Reality check, guy. The Democrats went along with the war because most of the country was in a mood to kill someone in 2003, and they didn't much care who. Then like naughty children who had too much candy, they looked for someone else to blame.

</quote>

I believe I said the same thing a few posts back. Yes, Democrats failed in their duty. So did the media. They are guilty of insufficient diligence. The Bush administration is guilty of actually pushing the war. You know, sins of omission and sins of commission.

The nation had a lot of questions about Iraq, and was willing to wait for inspections. Bush wasn't.

A dictator who wasn't a threat to us, hadn't caused us any problems, and who was actually co-operating with us at that point. And all he had to do was let power go to some crazy Islamists who are already sizing everyone up for Burhkas...

</quote>

Yes, and then his people rose up. Unlike the people of Iraq. They asked for UN help. Unlike the people of Iraq. They overthrew a dictator with limited help from the outside world. Unlike the war in Iraq.

They may choose badly in their new leader, but they are at least off to a good start.

Newt is a throw-back and has PLENTY of baggage. PLUS, he serially goes off on tangents when debating.
