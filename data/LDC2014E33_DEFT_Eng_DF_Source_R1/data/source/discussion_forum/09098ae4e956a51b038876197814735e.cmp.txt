It has just been announced that Gerald Ford, 38th President of the United States has died. He is unique in that he wasn't elected to office. His reputation in the UK was high, and he was seen as a nice man who could still take hard decisions. I remember being surprised when visiting American politicians tried to pour scorn on him after pardoning President Nixon. I think he made the right decision by so doing.

RIP.

In his 25 Years in the Congress, he was known for his integrity and honesty.

I don't know much about his politics or his achievements, but I heard a story on the radio today and it says something about his character.

His dog made a chocolate hotdog during dinner (this was when he was the president). The White House staff and Secret Service guys present scrambled to clean it up. He stopped them. He told them it's the responsibility of the owner to clean up after his dog.

The radio show host also said that Ford was a good post-president. He stayed out of the spotlight and didn't make any waves, unlike Jimmy Carter. GHW Bush is also a good post-president.

My favorite Gerald Ford quote: 'The government that is big enough to give you everything you want is also big enough to take everything you have.'

His veto pen was the mightiest Presidential kung fu in our history. Not a lot got done while he was Prez, and the Republic was better off because of it.

Not wanting to take anything from this fine man whom I respect, but it sure was fun watching him leave his plane. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/> We need more presidents like him.

I agree with his veto legacy, also noteworthy to mention is the blanket pardon he gave to Nixon to protect the sanctity of the presidentship, helping Canada to get in to G-8.

He served this nation in many capacities besides the political.

He was in the Navy during WWII and served in the Pacific Theatre. Most people are aware of that.

A little known fact is that he also has a conservation legacy as well. He was the only U.S. President who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout and he was also a summer park ranger in Yellowstone during the summer of 1936. No other U.S. President has served as a park ranger.

During his time in office he added 18 new areas to the National Park System. Among them: Chickasaw National Recreation Area, Oklahoma; Boston National Historical Park, Massachusetts; and Valley Forge National Historical Park, Pennsylvannia.
