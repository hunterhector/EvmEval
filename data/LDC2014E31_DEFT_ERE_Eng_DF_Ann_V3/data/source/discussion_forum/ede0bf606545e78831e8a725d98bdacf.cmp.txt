This thread is such a breath of fresh air. I'm so glad to see other people sharing my pain.

I am the National Sales Manager for my company working with Kmart. I received an e-mail from my buyers today requesting authorization to markdown or return product we sold them....in 2003. We let them return it for 4 years and stopped in 2007.

They were only looking for 24 dollars, but here's the catch; I know that they have over $270,000 worth of my inventory that isn't supposed to be there. The thing is, If I take back my $24, then I'll get a bill for nearly 300 grand.

Their employees and leadership are such shitheads they can't execute any changes, and are costing the company millions and millions. My company is really small, and Kmart could have been up almost a quarter million if they just did things a regular retailer would execute. On a similar note, if they try to bully me out of the money we just cut off shipments. Enjoy old inventory. The first time they went bankrupt they cost my company millions of dollars back when they were our biggest account. Time for payback. By the way, no offense to the employees here who knew what they were doing.

Another thing adding to the mess, is that the buyers will turn over again in 6 months and it will take a year for them to catch up. All you can do is try to squeeze a new line in when no one knows who is in charge and make a few bucks...then just ride that sweet sweet 5 year old product into the sunset.

Christ I hate Kmart...I'm getting depressed just thinking about it. Luckily, for every Kmart there is a Bed Bath and Beyond, Ulta, and Amazon.

Don't worry, Kameapart is doing some wonderful "purges" right now. Getting rid of people by removing their position. Best one to date? They removed the only person who knew out to receive product at a store.

I can't believe how different each store is, most of the ones I deal with have a loving idea and have their poo poo together, other ones....it's like roll the dice and see what they can gently caress up that day.

Amazon can be loving stupid too. I remember one time they couldn't find anyone to sign for a load of boxes. So I told them once they unfucked themselves, they can pay to have the load redelivered sometime next loving week, I'm going home. It was funny to watch someone chase me down on foot as I was driving off with a trailer full of boxes two weeks before xmas.

Best thing I've found at Kmart so far is a PS2 copy of High School Musical with two dance pads for $3.99. I feel cheated.

Truckstops are goldmines for this kind of stuff. When I was at the, I think, Sapp Bros in Omaha last summer the discount bin was full of old cassettes. Not good ones either. Hell, I woulda picked up a couple if they had anything even remotely decent as my rig (a 2004, mind you) anachronistically came with a cassette deck. There was only painfully bad stuff like Billy Ocean's Christmas album and the Best of Ray Stevens.

Another thing I used to see a lot was the autobiography by the founder of Flying J, O. Jay Call. Racks and racks of them. I don't see it too much anymore because he died and his company went bankrupt shortly after then "merged" with another.

Up until our store started closing the Borders I worked at had a Star Fox 64 Strategy Guide by Prima or one of the other non-Nintendo Power groups who did guides with a sticker marked 1999 I think. e: Might have been even earlier, don't remember.

It never came up as old stock in the RGIS nights because I guess it was so old and had been missed so many times before it had been assumed lost or stolen. I guess someone finally bought when it went on sale. <img src="http://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-iiam.gif"/>

You just reminded me how much I miss Borders. All we have now is a Barnes and Noble, and it's in a loving mall! <img src="http://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/emot-emo.gif"/> I just want to drive 10 minutes, park a reasonable distance from a store, and browse some books for a while. Is that too much to ask?!
