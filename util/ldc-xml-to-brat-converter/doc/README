1. Introduction
Annobase is a light-weight but comprehensive representation for text annotation
implemented in Java. A main goal of the software is to provide a human-readable
representation for text annotation that is easy to parse and extend, while also
providing linguistically-motivated sets of annotations and operations for them.

2. How to use this software
The software requires Java 8, or any later version of Java.  Below is an example
 of using Annobase.

  String text = "This is a sentence. This is another sentence";
  AnnotationBase annBase = new AnnotationBase(text);
  // Run your sentence segmenter and tokenizer, and set sentences and tokens to
  // the annotation base instance.
  List<Sentence> sents = annBase.getSentences();
  Sentence firstSent = sents.get(0);
  Token firstToken = firstSent.getFirstToken();
