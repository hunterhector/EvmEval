Lionel Tate who killed the 6 year old girl in while 'imitating a wrestling move' pleaded guilty to second degree murder yesterday. He served three years in lock up, now he is on one year house arrest and ten years probation. Lionel was 14 years old at the time and weighed 166lbs., she was 6 and weighed 48lbs. He was sentenced to life at age 14 but it has been overturned.

Is this just punishment for his crime?

Just?... Hardly. He didn't just "imitate a wrestling move". He kicked, punched and stomped her as well during a sustained beating, resulting in a fractured skull and a host of internal injuries. His mom, who is now in charge of the house arrest, was upstairs at the time of the murder. The kid is a monster with no respect for human life. His mom has already demonstrated her incompetence (she had yelled down the stairs "keep the noise down" while the murder was taking place). It is likely only a matter of time until he hurts someone else. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes"/>
