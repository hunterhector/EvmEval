I honestly don't know. But what I do know is for a generation now we have tried to label bad behavior as a medical condition. That removes any element of personal responsibility and as such we've had a generation of youth drugged by doctors diagnosis's of this ailment or that. It's sad

To make the painful decision to inter the appropriate rehab for the condition and stick with it takes plenty of personal responsibility.....As for the OP, not a fan of the Governor by any stretch but I'm fine with the decision.

Do you think that rehab works? Did it work for Any Weinhouse? She wrote a song about how it doesn't work. It made her a lot of money. Did rehab work for Charlie Sheen? Did rehab work for Whitney Houston?

Rehab doesn't work. The function of rehab is to teach people how to be more creative in assigning blame for their addictions.

We honor the absolute WORST among us. Schools lower flags to half mast to honor gang bangers who are murdered by other gang bangers.

I hate to offer this information as I'm sure it will be used against me later but your assumptions of what rehab teaches couldn't be any further from the truth.

I've been through rehab twice. Once when I was on parole. 90 days impatient and once court ordered after a dwi.

The main focus in rehab is on 2 things.

You are taught in great detail the effects drugs and alcohol have on your body and what happens to those organs as the addiction progresses.

Secondly they focus on individual behavior. Both the behavior that leads to use and the "new" behaviors you can use to avoided the desire to use again.

Ultimately the reason rehab fails is individual choice. In otherwords it can be a complete success if you make the individual choice to utilize the material given to you.

Antibiotics don't always work either, but the next time your doctor gives you some i would advise taking them.

Just because a treatment doesn't work 100% doesn't mean it shouldn't be used.

</quote>

Who said that? Anyone? Did anyone say that rehab shouldn't be used even if it is as useless as tits on a bull?

Entering rehab is NOT an exercise of personal responsiblity. It is part of the learning process to avoid personal responsibility. Addicts should NEVER be honored in any way whatsoever.

Why the hell should anyone go to rehab if it's "as useless as tits on a bull"? It's your point of view that ppl shouldn't go to rehab.

Entering rehab is an exercise of personal responsibility. Anytime someone is admitting they have a problem, and trying to fix it, they're exercising personal responsibility.

Let's say someone is addicted to alcohol, and runs into your burning house and saves your daughter or son's life, would you honor that person or shame them since they're still an addict?

Houston was an addict, and she donated millions and millions to charity. The hundreds and maybe thousands of ppl she helped weren't helped in any less of a way because she was an addict. She helped a hell of a lot more ppl than i'll ever be able to, she was an addict, i'm not.

Whitney Houston was knocking back straight whiskeys at 8AM the day she died AFTER a night of heavy partying. It takes real committment to the lifestyle to find this honorable. Jim Beam might want to lower their company flag to half mast. That I can see. Mexico might want to lower it's flag to half mast. That I can see. There might have been a time when Whitney Houston was a worthy person and could sing. That hasn't been for 15 years at least. At the time of her death she was reprehensible.

</quote>

Let's not go overboard here...

Reprehensible? She had a substance abuse problem and was unable to gain control over it. Addiction has been a problem for a thousand years. Most are able to avoid it, but those who can't, suffer for the rest of their lives

Again, my only objection is that I think the flag should be used to honor heroes and a pop singer is not a hero

</quote>

The day before Houston died, her daughter was found in the bathtub unconscious from her own drug use. She went to the hospital and released the same day, only to be readmitted the next day. That night Houston was partying it up and the next morning was in the restaurant knocking back straights as fast as poor Emilio could bring them.

Yes this is reprehensible. Beyond reprehensible.

Whoa... I pulled the 'give-a-shit' meter out of the desk drawer and I couldn't even get it to register.

Christie is within his rights as governor...

Yup and if the Gov in NJ wants to honor Houston then so what. I'm sure he'll hear from the residents of NJ if they don't like it.

NC flew its flags at half staff when Dale Earnhardt was killed and no one gave a shit.
