I simply don't get why Iran is such a huge threat.

They are merely retaliating to whatever our politicians throw at them!

"If Iran changes course, abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions, and lives up to its international obligations, it will be welcomed back into the community of nations."... As a weak country with no big weapons to defend its people.. Yeh right, they're so on board with that!

All the huge countries that are bullying Iran into submission right now with sanctions and what not have nuclear weapons? How on earth is this fair? All the sanctions is AFFECTING ORDINARY IRANIANS! Soaring food prices/ Fuel... Why is the world doing nothing?! Do we want Iran to become the next North Korea?

This is totally Unacceptable!

Not to mention the meddling we have been doing inside Iran for the past 100 years or so... installing the shah.. overthrowing democratic governments...

Hey Israel, how about you assassinate some more Iranian scientists?
Absolutely degrading behaviour by the west, no wonder they hate us!

Largely rhetoric to lay the groundwork to get support for the war. This wasn't done properly before going to war in Iraq and we had people opposed to it from the start, also going in with mixed messages 'its about WMD and a bit about regime change' looked bad when there weren't any WMD there. So we need to go in from the start saying with Iran it's about regime change, Ahmedinijad is bad, he doesn't respect womens rights or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapons and then go to war and don't find any nuclear weapons.

I can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation is bad and any of these states having nuclear weapons is not desirable as it just leads to proliferation in the region, but that argument should have been used against Pakistan and Israel getting nukes. People say Iran having nukes is a risk because terrorists might be able to get hold of nuclear material...well hello...Pakistan has them. Remember when we went in to take out Bin Laden we couldn't tell the Pakistani government for fear that Bin Laden would have been tipped off and escaped...that hardly fills me with confidence that they should be allowed to have nuclear weapons.

The problem with these 'resolutions' targeting Iran is that everyone can see the hypocrisy, its a case of our allies can have nukes but others can't. A much better resolution would have been a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region, which meant India and Pakistan had to disarm and Israel had to disarm, and any moves by any country in the region towards getting nuclear weapons would be met by international air strikes. I could definitely support that as a non proliferation treaty.
